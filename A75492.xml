            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have received by your moſt cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Letters, written ſome Moneths ſince to the Churches of Zeland, an expreſſe teſtimony not only of your entire friendſhip, but alſo of your confidence, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere affection towards us, into whoſe boſome you were pleaſed to poure forth your fluctuating minds. Our wiſhes and endeavours are, that we may give you a reall experiment of our brotherly compaſsion: for our very inmoſt bowels burn within us, with the zeale and love of Chriſt and the Saints, when we heare of the Churches of Chriſt in affliction, when the moanes and lamentations of our holy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren pierce our eares, and when we ſeriouſly conſider the cauſes of your calamities. O that our eyes were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into Fountaines of waters, that we might la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment day and night the deſolations of the people! Our mind trembles to heare the deſperate counſels and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked attempts of thoſe whoſe endeavour hath been to blot out from amongſt you the whole face of a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb facs="tcp:119921:5"/> Church, and totally to hinder all better counſels, and have brought it thus to paſſe, that the band of the Kingdome being broken, all things are now involved in a cruell warre, all hope of peace and agreement taken away, and the happineſſe of Church and Kingdome overthrowne. But as God doth by his favour proſper right counſels, ſo for the moſt part he brings the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked plots of men upon the heads of thoſe who contrive them, and by a divine wiſdome doth over-rule the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the world, whereby his Church is oppreſſed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the ſafety of his own, or a triall of their Piety. For whoever they are that truly love God, they doe not faſten the Anchor of all their hope on the barren ſands of mutable things and humane ſtrength, but on the ſolid Rock which cannot be moved by any waves, that is, Jeſus Chriſt, the Churches Husband, peculiar and preſent with every one. In whoſe boſome who-ever do with full confidence repoſe themſelves, and caſt all their care on him alone, are quiet in the midſt of troubles, and injoy comfort; and are as well thankfull in adverſity as in proſperity. Though, to ſpeake the truth, what is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, but that which hindereth us in our courſe to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall happineſſe? what is proſperous, but that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth to it? Chriſt is both the Husband, the Lord, and Phyſitian of the Church. The Husband, becauſe being out of love to us drawn to die, he hath knit us to himſelf, and himſelfe to us in an everlaſting Covenant: The Lord, becauſe by the price of his bloud he hath reſcued us from the tyranny of Satan, he governes us, and beares rule in us, and diſpoſeth at his pleaſure of his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety: The Phyſitian, becauſe he is the Saviour, he alone doth efficaciouſly heale the evils of men, diſpelling the diſeaſes and diſtempers of the ſoules, purging his Church, and reſtoring it to health. He is oft-times more mercifull when he ſendeth bitter things, then when he refreſheth with ſweet things. He knowes what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
<pb facs="tcp:119921:5"/> for his Church, and is neither ſlacke nor ſleepeth in the care of his. We oft-times judge thoſe things proſperous, which are moſt adverſe, and think thoſe things adverſe which are moſt proſperous: Our duty is to obey, it is Chriſts work to judge. All pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity is from him, from whom if it proceed not, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called proſperity: from him commeth adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, which, to us, he makes to be either a remedy, or a gain to Piety: by that he comforteth our infirmity, that we may be able to beare it, by this he tryeth and crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our faith: The Church cannot have entrance to the glory of heaven but by the croſſe, that is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way of all, whether we be Kings (as one ſpeakes) or poore Peaſants, every one muſt take up his own croſſe: But Chriſt liveth, ordering the Scene of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affaires by his ſecret counſell. We pray, therefore, that he who knoweth what is conducing to the good of mankind, of his Church, of you, would vouchſafe to inſpire ſuch counſels into the hearts of Princes, which may reſtore to you Godlineſſe, together with holy agreement, and proſperity: ſince we ſee we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but prayers left for the aſſwaging the flouds of troubles amongſt you. O God of Peace, remove this confuſion from the Church of thy Sonne, from the flouriſhing Kingdome of <hi>England.</hi> O Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, the fountaine of all peace, diſſipate the counſels of thoſe who out of a deſire of ſpoile, being greedy of glory, ſtirre up the tumults of warres, and waves of perſecutions, even againſt thoſe who deſerve it not. Thou art the Redeemer, ſave thine owne purchaſe: Thou art the Saviour, ſuffer not thoſe to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh who depend on thee: Thou art the Lord, vindicate thine own poſſeſſion: Thou art the Head, afford ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour to thy members: Thou art the Prince of Peace, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire thoſe that are thine with mutuall love: Thou art God, have compaſſion on thy ſuppliants. And you,
<pb facs="tcp:119921:6"/> Brethren, indure labours with a good courage, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your ſpirits, that for the cauſe of God, and the Churches good you may with aſſured hope and firme confidence undergoe whatever by the counſell of God is laid upon you. There is no affliction ſo great, but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature may beare it, if accuſtomed to it, eſpecially if there be Chriſtian Fortitude, godly confidence, and a couragious mind. Thinke with your ſelves not only thus, That the Affliction doth thereby become the more mild, if born with patience: but that alſo the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of the Goſpel binds you wholly to intruſt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your affaires to God our Saviour; like as one ſick and in danger of life commits himſelfe to the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an anointing, bathing, lancing, ſearing: being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that in whatſoever wayes he diſpoſeth of your troubleſome condition, he will do it all for your healths ſake. We are not to preſcribe to God, let him ſave or deſtroy, doe what he will; and know that he willeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is beſt for you; you ſhall have God with you while you labour with a good reſolution in a good cauſe; and you ſhall have with you the righteous cauſe of faith, which was ever at laſt victorious againſt all the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults and ſubtilties of the wicked, and will doubtleſſe be ſo now, though God in his juſt judgement for the grievous ſinnes of men may ſuffer the ſhip of his Church to be toſſed in theſe waves. Chriſt hath purchaſed the Church, his Spouſe with his owne precious bloud, and hath promiſed to be with her to the end of the world; he will not therefore now forſake her, but rather confound thoſe who feare not to extoll themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth; from the great and gracious God ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expect a happy iſſue. The ſeeds of mourning and of teares promiſe a harveſt of glory and joy.

Let your own conſciences judge, how hereſies of all kinds can paſſe unpuniſhed, manyfold ſeeds of ſchiſmes be ſpread without controll, and prophane doctrines of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors be commonly vented in publike, in that city which by ſo expreſſe, ſo ſacred, and ſevere an oath hath bound it ſelf in the preſence of God to caſt out all errors, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, ſchiſms, from the houſe of God. Pardon us, Reverend Brethren, it is juſt griefe of heart that enforceth us to complaine, for that we underſtand that in Religion, the publike worſhip of God, and the ſpirituall Government of the Church, there are ſuch confuſions riſe amongſt you: that thoſe amongſt you who endeaour ſchiſmes, ſpread hereſies, traduce the Reformed Churches, breed ſtirrs and render the Churches face polluted, do ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controll exult. The true Church of God favours, not ſeditious proceedings, as being, by inſtinct of its holy nature, averſe from all diſſention: for it is truly that Vine and that Figtree in the parable, in the booke of <hi>Iudges,</hi> which being by a meſſage from the Trees called upon to beare rule and to wage warre, anſwered, that they could not leave their naturall ſweetneſſe, and be involved in troubles. We exhort you therefore in the Lord, and do ſeriouſly in the abundance of charity require you, that you take care to diſcover a way and meanes whereby you wil endeavour the removall of this lothſome evill of ſchiſmes and errors, while the diſeaſe is yet curable, from the midſt of your nation, of your city. Unleſſe you do timely withſtand the ſpreading gangrene of ſeparatiſts and the unlawfull conventicles of ſchiſmaticks, farewell all ſacred diſcipline of the
<pb facs="tcp:119921:7"/> Church, due policy, and ſpirituall government. We have had experience, in the troubles of our Churches, of the ſubtiltie of thoſe who being day and night intent on innovating, leave no ſtone unmoved, go to and fro by ſea, by land, to gaine diſciples and patrons of their cauſe, and ſo at laſt by force and feare curb and oppreſſe the cauſe of Truth and of God. The remedie comes too late, when evils have gotten ſtrength by long delayes. The heavenly affaires of the Church goe to ruine, when by worldly reaſonings of humane wiſdome they are protracted, abated, retarded, ſetled and unſetled. It is not unknowne to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God what are the diſpoſitions of Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, who ſtudy to innovate, carry on their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires ſubtilly, and firſt like the myſteries of <hi>Ceres</hi> they keep them cloſe, and doe firſt covently ſow the ſeedes of diſſention, they love the darke, ſay, and unſay, and ſay againe, as they find ſutable to the affaires and times, and are hardly drawn forth in publike: but when with open face they come forth to the light, they threaten ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine: Believe us upon our own experience. You muſt therefore ſpeedily withſtand their deſignes at firſt. Theſe things we adviſe, Deare Brethren, with a mind trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and perplexed, yet brotherly and truly pious; for we ſigh, and from the moſt inward ſenſe of heart cry to God, both in private and publike, for your civill warrs, inteſtine confuſions, the dubious and darkſome condition of the Church with you. We are anxious for you, and therfore are forced to change our voice, and poure forth the griefe of our heart into your boſome. We are tranſported with zeale for the glory of God, the beauty of Gods houſe, the government of Chriſts Kingdome, and the Churches peaceable unity.

Reverend Brethren, we are deſirous to repay to you our debts. When our country was on a flame by the inteſtine diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about Religion; by your help, counſell, and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance were our wounds healed, our griefes aſſwaged: when you therefore ly under the ſame diſeaſe, we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in way of gratitude to heale you. This is our end: this is that we aime at. This our labour we beſtow to this end, that the ſeeds of ſchiſmes may be pulled up, that the divine government of the Church of Chriſt may be eſtabliſhed amongſt you, and the true peace of Chriſts Kingdome brought to you. We joyne therfore with theſe letters, our judgement concerning certaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies now agitated in your kingdome, we omit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, maintained by heretiks and ſchiſmatiks which diſturbe the peace of the Church, nouriſh diſſention, and put a ſtay to the deſired reformation of the Churches; not that we would call you to give an account at our tribunall; far be it from us; for we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that there are amongſt you, and thoſe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren who maintaine the contrary part in theſe contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, men learned, godly, lovers of peace, who are abundantly ſufficient in judging, explaining, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding all theſe controverſies; but in quenching a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon flame in a city, they not without cauſe runne to help even uncalled, whoſe neighbours houſe is on fire: we are bound not only by the ſame bonds of Eccleſiaſticall unity, but by the common danger, and hazard of the Reformed Churches, to afford our adviſe and prayers, for the removing of thoſe opinions which would bring
<pb facs="tcp:119921:8"/> injurious and deſtructive damage to our Reformation. You have called upon us, in your moſt courteous let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that we would be helpfull to you in your ſhaken condition by ſuch remedies as by our common adviſe ſhould be thought meet: and we have judged it at this time moſt ſutable, to ſhew to you, who are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, your diſeaſes and their remedies; to ſignifie the practiſe and lawes obſerved by our Churches, in their ſpirituall Government and publike Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and to vindicate them by the Word of God, againſt the erroneous conceits of ſome. Of Some, we ſay, for we are aſſured that the whole body of the Church is not yet infected with this ulcer: and therefore what we have gathered out of the publike writings daily publiſhed amongſt you, we deſire not to impute to any, but thoſe who defend, nouriſh, and maintain thoſe perverſe opinions, or receive them into their Churches. If ſome of thoſe brethren of the contrary opinion do in ought differ from them, we wiſh they would declare ſo much by publike writing, and expreſſe it by common conſent, that the Reformed Churches of Chriſt might be freed from the juſt feare which their writings have cauſed them to conceive. For not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe do the godly conceive that thoſe are hatching ſome monſter, that uſe ſhifts, and dare not with open face clearly ſet downe and maintaine their opinions. Therfore by the name of Chriſt and the love of the ſpirit we beſeech thoſe bretheren, that they would clearely, ſincerely, plainely and diſtinctly without the vizard of Rhetoricall flouriſhes, declare and deſcribe to us their Eccleſiaſticall policy, and forme of publick worſhip, not here and there a peece, but in the whole frame of it, and that they would not vent doubtfull expreſſions in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, but in a due order, which tendeth to edification, manifeſt it to the Reformed Churches of Chriſt, if there be ought deficient in their Eccleſiaſticall Government;
<pb facs="tcp:119921:9"/> that with a peaceable brotherly mind, and in a due man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the truth may be ſearched out, and held forth in publike to the eyes of all.

For any one to be a true member of the inviſible Church, we require, according to the Word of God, true juſtifying faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſpirituall Communion with Chriſt. The admiſſion of members into this Church is Gods work, who by effectuall ſaving Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth ingraft men into the myſticall body of Chriſt. But the admiſſion of members of the Church viſible is committed to the care of the Overſeers and Paſtors of the Church; who by the Word of God may admit none other to the compleat externall communion of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119921:10"/> Church viſible, and ought to admit all ſuch, who by externall federall holineſſe are ſeparated from the world, are inſtructed in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and of the true Religion, profeſſe the name of Chriſt, and walking without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in their outward converſation, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted in the judgement of Charity as true Beleevers, and upon examination of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip concerning theſe things, are received into brotherly and Eccleſiaſticall Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>We grant therefore in this queſtion. 1. That any one be <hi>in foro Dei,</hi> at Gods tribunall, a true member of the Church inviſible, there is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in him, that he be indued with reall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall holineſſe of regeneration, and juſtifying faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. That it is mans duty who will duly for Salvation joyne himſelfe to the Church, that he truly beleeve in Chriſt, and being indued with reall holineſſe, worſhip God aright in all his wayes.</p>
               <p>But we affirme, that to the externall and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, the Paſtors are to admit thoſe who profeſſe the true Religion and faith of Chriſt, lead their lives without ſcandall, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fallen into ſcandals doe by repentance waſh them away <hi>in foro Eccleſiae,</hi> at the Churches Tribunall, ſubmit themſelves to Diſcipline, publikely frequent all exerciſes of divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,

So <hi>Trelcatius</hi> the elder, in his common places, <hi>loco</hi> 15. puts the <hi>differences between the members of the viſible and of the inviſible Church, in a lively faith, purity of life, certainty of Election and Salvation, and Perſeverance in faith; which are found in the members of the Church inviſible in ſincerity and truth; but in the members of the Church viſible only in the judgement of Charity, oft-times not in truth, becauſe of a vocation and profeſſion externall, but oft hypocriticall.</hi> So almoſt all the eminent Reformed Divines affirme <hi>the matter of the Church viſible to be men outwardly called profeſſing the faith of Chriſt;</hi> for they define it to be, <hi>a company of men, who by an outward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or the preaching of the Word and participation of the Sacraments, are called to the exerciſe of the Worſhip of God, and Eccleſiasticall Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip amongſt themſelves.</hi> See both the <hi>Trelca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tii</hi> in their common places, <hi>loco de Eccleſia.</hi> The <hi>Profeſſours of Leyden, disp. 40. theſ.</hi> 33. Hence
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119921:13"/> alſo have our <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches in our Nationall and Provinciall Synods ordeined, <hi>that he be admitted to the Lords Supper, who hath firſt made profeſſion of his faith, ſubmitted himſelfe to the Diſcipline of the Church, and brought teſtimony of unblameable life.</hi> See the Synods at Dort, <hi>Anno 1574. art.</hi> 70. and <hi>Anno 1578. art.</hi> 64. at Middleburgh, <hi>Anno 1581. art.</hi> 43. at the Hage, <hi>Anno 1586. art.</hi> 54. at Middleburgh, <hi>Anno 1591. art.</hi> 51. at Dort, <hi>Anno 1619. art.</hi> 61.</p>
               <p>We reject therefore theſe enſuing opinions, I. Of thoſe who affirme the externall and particular viſible Church to be the proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to which belongeth the Covenant of Grace, all the Promiſes of God, the Properties, and Priviledges which Chriſt the Mediatour hath purchaſed for his Church. The reaſons of our deniall are:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe that Church for which theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges are purchaſed, is perpetuall which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver falleth away: for this infallible Promiſe is made to it from God, <hi>Jer. 31. 36. Matt.</hi> 16. 18. But now no particular viſible Church is ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from falling away, as our Orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines demonſtrate againſt the Papiſts: it is not for it, therefore, that theſe Priviledges are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Chriſt the Mediatour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe Churches, for which all theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Priviledges are procured, are called out of the world, by the word and Spirit of God, to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119921:13"/> faith and holineſſe, and have ſincere and inward Communion and fellowſhip with Chriſt and all true beleevers: whence frequently in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they are called the <hi>Spouſe</hi> and <hi>Beloved</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>Cant. 4. 7. Eph.</hi> 5. 27. The <hi>Holy Sion,</hi> and <hi>heavenly Jeruſalem:</hi> and the <hi>Iſrael of God, Iſai. 52. 1. Gal.</hi> 4. 26. and 6. 16. ſo likewiſe, <hi>The Church which Christ hath purified for himſelfe, to preſent her to himſelfe glorious not having ſpot or wrinckle,</hi> Eph. 5. 27. The <hi>Body of Chriſt fitly joyned together and compacted by that which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry joynt ſupplyeth,</hi> Eph. 4. 16. It's called <hi>Chriſts people whom he ſaveth from their ſins,</hi> Joh. 10. 16. Matt. 1. 21. <hi>Gods houſe, and a holy Prieſthood,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 5. <hi>The Temple of God, in which the Spirit of God doth dwell,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 16. <hi>The Lambs wife,</hi> Apoc. 21. 4. All which, and ſuch like, doe not agree to an externall viſible particular Church, as ſuch, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6. but onely to the Church inviſible, which Chriſt had redeemed with his bloud, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Priviledges promiſed and procured for the Church of God (amongſt many others) are theſe, That God <hi>puts his Law,</hi> and <hi>his Feare into the minds</hi> of the members of it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. That they are <hi>all taught of God, and know him. Joh.</hi> 6. 42. That they are <hi>redeemed by the bloud of Chriſt,</hi> Act. 20. 28. Eph. 5. 27. But theſe agree not to an externall and viſible particular Church: Therefore that externall viſible par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119921:14"/> Church is not the proper ſubject of the Covenant of grace, or of theſe Priviledges which by Chriſt our Mediatour are procured for the Church.</p>
               <p>Whereunto the Reformed Divines aſſent, See (amongſt others) the <hi>Profeſſours of Leyden,</hi> in their <hi>Synopſis Theologiae, diſput. 40. Theſ.</hi> 29, 30, 31. And <hi>Ames</hi> himſelfe againſt <hi>Bellarm. tom. 2. lib. 2. cap. 1. not.</hi> 10. where he affirmes <hi>that thoſe glorious things which are ſpoken in Scripture of the Church of Chriſt, that it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by Chriſt, the Body of Chriſt, the Spouſe of Chriſt, quickned, acted, and guided by the Holy Spirit, partaketh of all ſpirituall bleſſings, ſo that the gates of hell ſhall never prevaile againſt it; doth properly and fully agree not to the whole multitude of thoſe that profeſſe the Chriſtian faith, but to thoſe only that are true beleevers: or, they agree to the Church militant according to i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s eſſentiall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture peculiar to true beleevers; not according to its externall manner of exiſtence, in which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded both godly and reprobates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. We reject the opinion of thoſe, who think that in the Church none are to be admitted as members into the externall fellowſhip of the Church, but ſuch as have been by a ſtrict exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination firſt tried by other beleevers, or the Elders of the Church, in the exerciſes of Piety, the duties of Prayer, holy conferences, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Communion, and have manifeſted to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119921:14"/> them evident ſignes of Regeneration: and have afterwards, before the whole body of the Church, publikely profeſſed a ſincere confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith; and have either by a continued ſpeech, or by queſtions and anſwers, made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by evident ſignes the ſaving grace of God in them, whereby they are tranſlated from the kingdome of darkneſſe to the Kingdome of God; and ſuch a ſpirit that in a Church Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſincerely, faithfully, and godlily in the preſence of God and the whole Church, they both can and will walk in the wayes of God. For we reade not that in the Apoſtolicall Church this manner of admitting Church members was in uſe. Thoſe three thouſand, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. were not in this manner added to the Church of Chriſt: but men were upon ſuch a confeſſion joyned to the Church of Chriſt, as whereby hypocrites and perſons not converted might have entrance into the Church: and that under the inſpection of the Apoſtles, who were indued with extraordinary gifts of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Whence alſo in our Reformed Churches of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> members of Churches are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by a confeſſion of the true Faith and Religion, a ſolemne Proteſtation to ſubmit themſelves to the Diſcipline of the Church, a teſtimony of an unblameable and inoffenſive life. As alſo <hi>Ames</hi> himſelfe affirmeth, <hi>that men
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119921:15"/> are duly admitted into the Church by a confeſſion of Faith, and promiſe of obedience. Medull. lib. 1. cap. 32. theſ.</hi> 17. And in ſome more numerous Churches in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> it is the cuſtome and practiſe, for the Churches greater prudence in admitting members, that thoſe who deſire admiſſion into Church-communion, before their ſolemne profeſſion of faith, are for ſome weekes ſeverall times privately exerciſed, and inſtructed if they be not ſufficiently exerciſed; and this inſtruction is by the Miniſters in the Viſitation of their ſeverall precincts, and is alſo publikely offered to all, when notice is given of celebrating the Lords Supper. The Miniſters inquire likewiſe of the integrity of life and converſation of thoſe who expect communion with us: Afterwards they uſe to undergoe an examination before the conſiſtory in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtoriall meeting, or before the delegates of the Conſiſtorie; which is performed by the Miniſter through all the points of Catechiſme; And laſt of all having been thus tryed, they do in publike before the body of the Church by a bare affirmation give anſwer to theſe generall Poſitions, <hi>Whether or no they acknowledge the Doctrine of our Churches to be the Orthodox faith and the way of Salvation? Whether or no they promiſe, by the grace of God, to perſiſt till death in the Profeſſion of this Doctrine? Whether or no they promiſe to live holily and as becommeth this
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119921:15"/> Doctrine? Whether or no they ſubmit themſelves to the Diſcipline of the Church?</hi> In this manner are thoſe who deſire admiſſion, admitted to our Church Communion. This cuſtome though laudable, is not indeed contrary, but yet is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the order of our Churches; and is not in uſe in all our Churches: which therefore we do not urge as abſolutely neceſſary, but make uſe of it, for the greater Eccleſiaſticall prudence in ſo grave and ſerious a matter. In the meane time we eſteeme that order eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in our Eccleſiaſticall conſtitutions to be ſufficient for the due admitting of members in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Church Communion, according to the word of God.</p>

               </p>
               <p>THe Reformed Churches judge it neceſſary to the conſtitution of a particular viſible Church, that there be ſacred union in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Eccleſiaſticall communion, expreſſed by certaine externall acts appointed by God, and to be exerciſed in a viſible Church ſociety, under one miniſtry, and ſpirituall diſcipline. But this union, they affirme, the members of a true Church enter into amongſt themſelves, when they are united in one externall profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the truth and holyneſſe, and in the ſame baptiſme; and will frequent the ſame divine worſhip, be ſubject to the ſame Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, be governed by the ſame law and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction Eccleſiaſticall; and do ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ſame diſcipline, and partake of the ſame Supper of the Lord. And in this union there is, they affirme, a kind of tacit and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Covenant, which uniteth the faithfull into a particular Church: although ſuch a ſolemne Covenant betweene them in expreſſe termes be not publikely entered into before the whole Church, as the queſtion requireth.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:119921:16"/>
               <p>We grant in this controverſy:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is a Covenant of ſaving grace between God and repenting Sinners, founded in Chriſt the Mediator: whereby all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are obliged to the performance of all duties of piety which he hath commanded in his word, as well in Church communion and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, as out of it: by which Covenant all thoſe who are truly partakers of it obtain right to all thoſe ſaving benefits which are contained in the promiſes of this Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there is a tacit or virtuall Covenant between the members of one and the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall particular Church: whereby they are obliged to the performance of thoſe mutuall duties, which are required of the members of a viſible Church in reference to their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church communion: as that they will be ſubject to the care and Diſcipline of their own Paſtors, frequent the ſame publike worſhip of God, and be ruled by the ſame law and juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction Eccleſiaſticall: by which Covenant they alſo obtain to themſelves right to thoſe things which are peculiar to this particular Church, and the members thereof, and do not belong to other particular Churches.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We grant that there may be an expreſſe and ſolemne Covenant, in the preſence of God and the Church, upon extraordinary occaſions, entered into, by all the members of the viſible
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119921:17"/> Church of one nation or kingdome: when the Church in that kingdome or nation hath made defection from God and his worſhip, or ſome other neceſſity call for it; for the preſerving, or propagating, or reſtoring of the decayed worſhip of God. By which Covenant not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding there doth not accrew to the Church of that kingdome any new right, but that right which before they had to injoy the ordinances of God, which by reaſon of their defection, or ſome other cauſe, was hindered and as it were ſuſpended, they may now freely and purely again reduce to practiſe. Thus did the Church of God under the Old Teſtament often in the time of defection, or extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neceſſity, enter into a ſolemne Covenant in the preſence of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Neither do we hold that the Covenant men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Queſtion, is for the matter of it alltogether unlawfull: for it is lawfull alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely, publikely, and ſolemnly to vow to God thoſe things which are in the precepts of God enjoyned to all beleevers: But that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of making this publike, ſolemne, and expreſſe Covenant, in the preſence of the whole Church, requiring it as a thing of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity to the eſſentiall conſtitution of a particular Church, we do not acknowledge: but that union above mentioned, we conceive ſufficient by the word of God for the joyning
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119921:17"/> men profeſſing the faith into one particular Church. So that, by the word of God, to the eſſence and intireneſſe of a particular Church, this union is ſufficient.</p>
               <q>We deny therefore in this controverſy:</q>
               <p n="1">1. That a ſolemne and expreſſe Church Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, between the Governors of a Church and the Members of it, publikely entered into before the whole Church, for the performance of all exerciſes of piety in a holy communion with God and amongſt themſelves, is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary and eſſentiall to the conſtitution of a true viſible Church, ſo that without ſuch a Covenant there would be no viſible Church of God, no member of a true or pure Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We deny allſo, that by ſuch a Church-Covenant that right is obtained which the members of a Church in Eccleſiaſticall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion have to the Sacraments of grace, the priviledges of the Eccleſiaſticall Miniſtry and other benefits which Chriſt hath given to his Churches.</p>
               <q>The Reaſons of our deniall are theſe:</q>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Apoſtles have not ordained any ſuch Church-Covenant betweene the Members and the Paſtors of a Church; neither in the admiſſion of Members into the Church did require ſuch a Covenant as neceſſary: but by the Sacrament of Baptiſme they received ſuch as profeſſed the truth and holineſſe in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119921:18"/> the Church viſible, and joyned in the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of divine worſhip with thoſe who were without any ſuch Covenant received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Eccleſiaſticall body with themſelves. See <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 42, 47. &amp; 5. 13. &amp; 8. 12. &amp; 9. 26. &amp; 18. 8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Under the Old Teſtament the particular Churches in the Synagogues entred not into any ſolemne Church Covenant in the admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of members: but only on extraordinary occaſions, when they had made defection from God, all the faithfull of the whole nationall Church renewed their Covenant with God, for reſtoring the decayed worſhip of God; or when they were by ſome other neceſſity cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon for renewing ſuch a Covenant.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No man can injoyne any thing upon the conſciences of men, (as abſolutely neceſſary to injoying the Sacraments of divine grace, and the benefits of the Miniſtery of the Church,) which God hath not injoyned; without dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable wil-worſhip. But God hath not injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſuch a Covenant on the conſciences of men as abſolutely neceſſary: for there is no law of God wherein he hath injoyned a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of this Covenant as the eſſentiall form of Church-communion, ſo as that without it no man can be member of a viſible Church, or have right to the ſeales of the Covenant: Therefore the neceſſity of this Covenant is a will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119921:18"/> and ſo to be rejected.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The meanes whereby the members of a Church viſible are aſſociated and united into externall Eccleſiaſticall communion, are Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme under the New Teſtament, as Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was under the Old Teſtament, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. as <hi>Cornelius, Acts 10. 47. Lydia, Acts</hi> 16. 15. &amp; others, were by Baptiſme ingrafted into the body of the Church viſible: which in thoſe of yeares is joyned with an imbracing and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſound Doctrine and ſubjection to the ordinances of God; as appeares in the believers, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41. the <hi>Bereans, Acts</hi> 17. 10. and by Chriſts commandement, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19.</p>
               <p>Hence ſay the Profeſſors of Leyden, <hi>that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the primary uſes of the Sacrament of Baptiſme, there are other ſecondary uſes of it: to wit, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ingrafting them into a particular viſible Church,</hi> Acts 2. 41. <hi>the uniting of Chriſts mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers amongſt themſelves, and into one body:</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 12. <hi>and conſequently upon theſe, a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of our profeſſion; and a diſtinction and ſeparation from all other aſſemblies of unbeleevers.</hi> This Church-Covenant therefore is not the formall reaſon of our Eccleſiaſticall communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Church viſible. Hence allſo our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Netherlands in admitting of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors or Church members do not enter into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch Church Covenant: which yet are true viſible Churches of God; whoſe members
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119921:19"/> have all eſſentiall requiſites neceſſary to Church communion in the viſible Church.</p>
               <q>We reject therefore the Opinions of thoſe:</q>
               <p n="1">1. Who make this Church-covenant to be the Forme of the Church of God: ſo that true beleevers profeſſing the faith are indeed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials of a Church, who yet ſo long as they have not entered into ſuch a Covenant want the Forme of it; and therefore are no true Church of God. The Argument upon which we reject this poſition, is, becauſe the Forme of a thing gives it its being and operation, ſo that there can be no property, no operation, or act of a true Church in ſuch an Eccleſiaſticall company, who are not joyned in ſuch a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. And therefore this opinion depriveth all the Reformed Churches, which are not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſuch a Church-covenant, of a true Church Miniſtery, of the power of calling and ordaining Miniſters, of a lawfull adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacraments, of Eccleſiaſticall Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, &amp;c. And denies all that are baptized, &amp;c. in thoſe Churches, to be truely and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baptized, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We reject alſo the opinion of thoſe, who make this Church-covenant to be that moment of time, wherein the Miniſter of a Church hath Church-power over his Congregation committed to him; and the people injoy the benefits of his Eccleſiaſticall function; and the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119921:19"/> members of the particular Church amongſt themſelves exerciſe the care and power, and hold Eccleſiaſticall communion and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; whereas it is certain out of the Word of God, that the Miniſters and Paſtours of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches receive Eccleſiaſticall power over their flockes, and the people become ſubject to the Miniſtery of their Paſtours for the Salvation of their ſoules and their mutuall edification in faith, not from any contract which thoſe men make amongſt themſelves, but from Gods Calling, whereby the Paſtours are ſent forth by the Church of Chriſt to the Miniſtery; and the flock injoyned by divine appointment, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the miniſtery and labour of their Paſtours by Gods inſtitution for their ſalvation: See 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 1, 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 Cor. 5. 20. Epheſ. 4. 11, 12. 1 Theſ.</hi> 5. 11, 12. and it's certaine alſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers amongſt themſelves have charge of each other by vertue of the communion of Saints, whereby they all diſperſed through the whole world are aſſociated into one body, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. and 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 14, 15. and by the duty of Charity which requires this mutuall care from all. <hi>Lev. 19. Heb.</hi> 3. and 10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We reject alſo the opinion of thoſe who affirme, that the Sacraments of the Old and New Teſtament, are ſignes and ſeales to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme this Church-covenant, and ſo inſtituted by God for the ratifying of it; that they are to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119921:20"/> be adminiſtred to thoſe only, who are by ſuch a Church-covenant united amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but to be denied to others, though knowne to be Godly, who be not in ſuch a Church-communion and ſtrict fellowſhip. Whereas it doth moſt cleerly appeare out of the holy Scriptures that the Sacraments were inſtituted by God in his Church, chiefly and in the firſt place to be ſignes and ſeales of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and of the benefits promiſed in the Covenant of Grace, and of Salvation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by Chriſt for us, as is manifeſt by the Sacrament of Circumciſion, <hi>Gen. 17. 7, 10. Rom.</hi> 4. 11. of the Paſſeover, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. of Baptiſme, <hi>Mark 1. 4. Act.</hi> 2. 38, 39. and 22. 16. <hi>Rom. 6. 3 4. Tit.</hi> 3. 5. and of the Lords Supper, <hi>Matth. 26. 26, 27, 28. 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 24, 25, 26. But in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary reſpect we acknowledge the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be ſeales of our outward ingrafting into the Church viſible, and our conjunction into one body of the Church, <hi>Act. 2. 41. 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 12, 13. and that, as we conceive, of the Catholicke Church; ſo that he that is bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed is not baptized into the communion only of this or that particular, or parochiall Church, but is joyned into that one body of the Church Catholike and univerſall: as the whole Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Church is given by Chriſt to men, to bring them to the unity and conjunction of the Church Catholike and univerſall, and to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119921:20"/> ingraft them as members into it, <hi>Eph. 4. 11, 12. 1 Cor. 12. 28. Rom.</hi> 12. 5, 6, 7. And as by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication duly performed the perſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate is not caſt out of this or that particular Church only, but is bound all the world over, and ſhut out from the brotherly communion of the Church univerſall, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17, 18. ſo the Sacraments of Baptiſme and the Lords Supper are ſeales to a man of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall communion, not only in a particular Church, but in the Church univerſall. And therefore we hold that theſe Sacraments are to be adminiſtred not to thoſe only who by a Church Covenant have joyned themſelves to ſome particular Church, but to all the members of the Church Catholike, who have duly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared themſelves for the partaking of them. Thus our Belgick Churches deny not the ſeale of Baptiſme to the children of thoſe parents, who have not by a confeſſion of faith and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline, joyned themſelves to any particular Church; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the practiſe of the Jewiſh Church, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5. 4, 6. as neither doe we deny the participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords Supper to thoſe who by reaſon of the neceſſity of their calling cannot joyne themſelves to any particular Church, but are forced to travell through divers Parochiall Churches.</p>

               <p>VVHether no other externall viſible Church be deſcribed in Scripture, and acknowledged by the word of God, but a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochiall or particular Church: which is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſuch limits, as that of neceſſity it muſt be ſuch as may be contained, and ought to meet, ordinarily in one place, for the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Gods publike worſhip, and all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God with mutuall edification: ſo that the conſtitution of ſuch a Church, which by reaſon of their multitude, or ſome other cauſe, cannot in all their members meet ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily in one place for the celebration of the worſhip of God and exerciſe of all Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, is unlawfull and repugnant to the word of God and the Apoſtles inſtitutions concerning the conſtitution of a Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the holy Scripture?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſwer.</label>
               </p>
               <p>VVE judge an externall viſible particular Church, to be a Church duly and lawfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted according to the patterne of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches erected by the Apoſtles, which, when it may be, doth in one Place under the inſpection of one Paſtor and Elders adjoyned, frequent
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119921:21"/> the ſervice of God for their mutuall edification. But when, by reaſon of the multitude which God daily addeth to the Church, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe, it cannot meet in one place, but doth in ſeverall places exerciſe the divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God and the work of the Miniſtery, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der more Paſtors and Elders joyned into one Conſiſtory, Preſbytery, or Claſſis; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of ſuch a Church, we ſay, doth very well agree with the word of God, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall inſtitution. And therefore wee alſo conceive that the viſible Church deſcribed in the holy Scripture, is not only a parochiall or particular Church, but that there is alſo a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall and Univerſall Church, diſperſed through a whole kingdome, yea through the whole world; which doth in Eccleſiaſticall communion make up one body Catholike. Yea we affirme that the name Church in Scripture is applyed to a company of Elders with Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for tranſacting Church affaires.</p>
               <p>Therefore concerning a viſible Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by the word of God we defend theſe following poſitions.</p>
               <p>1. That the conſtitution of ſuch a Church, which by reaſon of its multitude, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe, cannot meet ordinarily in one place for celebrating Divine worſhip, and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ordinances of God, is lawfull, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119921:22"/> to the word of God and the Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call inſtitution, though they exerciſe the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God and the work of the Miniſtry in diverſe places, under ſeverall Paſtors and Elders joyned into one Presbitery. This poſition is proved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the conſtitution of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> inſtituted and erected by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, which could not meet in one place, but muſt by reaſon of their multitude meet diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butively from houſe to houſe in divers places, under the inſpection of divers Paſtors: and yet was a viſible inſtituted Church, and is called in Scripture <hi>a Church</hi> in the ſingular number. For the number of that Church was ſo great, that three thouſand were added to it in one day, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 41. and the number of thoſe that beleeved and were added to the Church grew up to the number of five thouſand men, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 4. and the number of thoſe that believed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed daily more and more both of men and women. <hi>Act. 5. 14. Act.</hi> 2. 47. which yet daily met, and that in the time of perſecution, from houſe to houſe for performing the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of Divine worſhip. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 46. and 5. 42.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Church of Epheſus, duly conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to the word of God, was one Church. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 2. which yet was gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by divers Paſtors joyned in a common Presbitery for Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, <hi>Acts</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:119921:22"/> 19. 8, 9. and 20. 17, 18. which did allſo very greatly abound in multitude of members, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 10, 17, 18, 19, 20. and 20. 20, 21. 1 <hi>Cor. 16. 8. Revel.</hi> 2. 2, 3. And yet met in ſome private houſe for celebrating the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 9, 10. and 20. 20. But that this whole multitude could in one ſchoole or houſe celebrate the worſhip of God, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: It's certaine therefore to us that they met in divers places and at divers times under the inſpection of divers Paſtors.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did not meet in one place for celebrating the worſhip of God, there were more holy aſſemblies there in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places; there was a Church in the houſe of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla, Rom. 16. 5. Paul</hi> when he was at Rome had holy Church Aſſemblies in his owne houſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 23, 30, 31. which yet was not that whole (collectively taken) and famous Church of the believing Romans, <hi>whoſe faith was famous through the whole world. Rom.</hi> 1. 8. Other examples we meet with in the Scripture of Churches duly conſtituted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods appointment, which met not in one place for exerciſing the worſhip of God, but did in divers places under a common Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery of divers Paſtors performe holy duties. Hence allſo in our <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches in ſome greater townes, though there be more belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers then can celebrate the holy worſhip of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119921:23"/> God, and exerciſe other ordinances of Chriſt, together in one place; yet they are not divided into ſeverall Churches, but do together make one viſible Church, under the common Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitery and government of divers Paſtors.</p>
               <p>II. We affirme, that a viſible Church deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the holy Scripture, was not only paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiall or particular, but there was allſo a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Church, of one nation or kingdome, which conſiſteth of many and divers parochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Churches, joyned under one Eccleſiaſticall government, and knit together amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by a mutuall viſible communion and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip Eccleſiaſticall. We deny indeed that there can be any ſuch Typicall Nationall Church now under the New Teſtament, as the Jewiſh Church was; wherein all of that nation were bound to a publike and ſolemne Typicall worſhip to be performed, in one place choſen by God, under the inſpection of one viſible paſtor or prieſt, who in worſhip and Sacrifices did hold forth and repreſent the whole people or nation. For this vaniſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the types and carnall precepts of the Old Teſtament. We reject allſo that Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and Provinciall forme of a Church, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by men, in which many Churches are united and ſubjected to a Cathedrall Church, and depend upon one viſible Paſtor, who is Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor and Lord of all other paſtors and inferior
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119921:23"/> particular Churches; wherin the inferior Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches injoy Gods holy ordinances, and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall power by derivation and commiſſion from the power and juriſdiction of that Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall Church or that Nationall or Provinciall Paſtor and Biſhop. For theſe are the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Antichriſt, which bring a tiranny into the Church, and overthrow the power gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God to the Churches and paſtors. Yet ſuch a Nationall and provinciall Church we acknowledge, wherein many particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are by one viſible Miniſtery and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government joyned into one collective Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall body viſible, for celebrating all thoſe ordinances of God which are neceſſary to the viſible miniſteriall government of thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and mutuall Eccleſiaſticall followſhip in it. This notion of a Church we deduce from Scripture by theſe arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Church of God under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament conſiſted of many particular Churches &amp; Synagogues, which did in divers places cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the worſhip of God, and the exerciſes of Doctrine, Diſcipline and Church-Government; as appeareth, <hi>Act. 15. 21. Act. 13. 15, 16. Luk. 21. 12. Ioh.</hi> 12. 42. all which were yet conjoined into one national viſible Church which God had choſen out of every nation and people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 7. and 32. 8. But the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the New Teſtament are of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119921:24"/> and forme, in all effentialls which do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a Church; as having the ſame Faith, the ſame Covenant of grace, the ſame ſignes of that Covenant for ſubſtance, the ſame way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſame Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the ſame viſible profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith (which conſtitute a Church viſible) common to both, and differ only in accidentall typicall ceremonies, which change not the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and forme of a Church. Hence Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant writers obſerve, that the holy Scripture doth not refuſe to make uſe of the name <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue</hi> to denote a Chriſtian Church, <hi>Jam. 2. 2. 2 Theſ. 2. 1 Heb. 10. 25. For when as the Church of both Teſtaments is one and the ſame, for eſſence, there is no reaſon why both people may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by one and the ſame name,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tilenus</hi> in his <hi>Theſes. part. 2. diſput. 14. Theſ.</hi> 3. It was morall and perpetuall therfore, that thoſe many Synagogues, and parochiall or particular Churches, ſhould unite into one Church Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall. Hence allſo the Jewiſh Churches brought to the faith of Chriſt under the New Teſtament, though diſperſed through divers Countries, were joyned into one Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body, ruled by the ſame law, government and Eccleſiaſtciall diſcipline. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1, 2. compared with <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 1, 2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Church of <hi>Galatia</hi> conſiſting of many ſeverall particular Churches, as appeareth <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 2. and yet was united into one Eccleſiaſticall
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119921:24"/> body of that nation, and united in a Church ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety under one common Diſcipline and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: Hence <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 9. it's compared to a <hi>Lump</hi> which is eaſily corrupted by a little lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; like as the united and compacted body of the Corinthian Church is ſet forth by the ſame ſimilitude, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6. He giveth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand to the Galathians co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning an uniformity of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in externall diſcipline and worſhip to be obſerved amongſt them, againſt the ſeducers &amp; falſe teachers, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 10. &amp;c. and 5. 9, 10. which intimates an united authority in Church government; whereby the falſe teachers might be removed out of all the particular Churches. The Church of <hi>Galathia</hi> therefore was Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The particular Churches of one province or nation, which in the miniſteriall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in Eccleſiaſticall fellowſhip and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion are conjoyned and united into one vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Eccleſiaſticall body, for the exerciſing vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible acts of Church communion joyntly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves; thoſe conſtitute a Church Provinciall or Nationall. For the members which do in an Eccleſiaſticall manner mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exerciſe amongſt themſelves viſible acts of Eccleſiaſticall communion, and doe together jointly participate in the ſame acts and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of a Church, they make one viſible body of a Church. But the particular Churches of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119921:25"/> one Nation doe according to the Word of God, exerciſe amongſt themſelves ſuch viſible Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall communion: for they doe by their particular members, by their Paſtours and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders delegated, ſometimes heare the ſame Word, frequent the ſame divine Worſhip, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the ſame Sacraments; and doe ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avoid and ſhut out from the Kingdome of Chriſt the ſame excommunicated perſon; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, reprove, comfort, and mutually edifie one another Eccleſiaſtically: and when one of them hath made defection from the Goſpell of Chriſt, others indeavour by Eccleſiaſticall Miniſtry and the Diſcipline of Chriſt to reduce it into the right way; and, if they refuſe to hearken to their Eccleſiaſticall admonition, they judge them as a company of heathens and publicans, avoid, and exclude them from their holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. Since then the Churches of one people or nation performe amongſt themſelves theſe ſpecificall exerciſes of Eccleſiaſticall communion and union; there is therefore a coalition of them into a Church Nationall. Hence alſo our Churches of the Netherlands in their Synodall Canons have ordained not only Eccleſiaſticall Aſſemblies, Conſiſtoriall, Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriall, and Claſſicall; but have alſo often decreed that Synods Provinciall and Nationall are to be called for the Eccleſiaſticall judging of the affaires of the Church. As appeares by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119921:25"/> the Synod at Emda, <hi>Anno 1571. art.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9. at Dort, <hi>Anno 1578. art.</hi> 16, 17. at Middleburgh, <hi>Anno 1581. art.</hi> 20, 21. at the Hagh, <hi>Anno 1586. art.</hi> 26, 27. at Middleburgh, <hi>Anno 1591. art.</hi> 25, 26. at Dort, <hi>Anno 1619. art.</hi> 29, 30. where it is decreed, that there ſhall be foure ſorts of Church Aſſemblies held, to wit, Conſiſtories, Claſſes, Synods Provinciall and Nationall: wherein nothing but Eccleſiaſticall affaires may be handled, and that in an Eccleſiaſticall manner.</p>
               <p>III. We affirme that there is deſcribed in Scripture an univerſall externall Church, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed through the whole world, which in a viſible polity maketh one. Eccleſiaſticall orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall body, under which are contained all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, Claſſicall, Provinciall, and Nationall Churches, as parts of that whole. This aſſertion we thus prove from Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 28. God hath ſet ſome in the Church,</hi> &amp;c. where by the word <hi>Church</hi> is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified that one body of which there are many members, ſpoken of <hi>ver.</hi> 12. wherein is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the Inviſible and myſticall Church of Chriſt, as ſuch; but the Church of Chriſt as Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and externall: as being that which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by the viſible Sacrament or ſigne of Baptiſme, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. which conſiſteth of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and heterogeneous externall members and organs, <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16, 17, 18. to which are given
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119921:26"/> from God thoſe various and externall admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations for edification, ſpoken of <hi>ver.</hi> 28. which is ſubject to Schiſme and ſeparation, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. Nor is it any Particular Church that is there deſcribed, but the Univerſall and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church; wherein all, as well Jewes as Gentiles, are joyned into one body, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. which comprehends all that are baptized in one Spirit, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. to which are given from God, Apoſtles, Prophets, Teachers, Paſtours, the gifts of tongues and miracles, &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 28. which are not given to this or that particular, but to the Catholike Church viſible. There is therefore here deſcribed an Univerſall Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is by the Word of God ſome fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and communion Eccleſiaſticall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene all the viſible Churches of the whole world; and therefore we muſt acknowledge by the Inſtitution of Chriſt a univerſall body of the Church: For there is between them an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall fellowſhip and an obligation to mutuall duties of Chriſtianity, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5, 6. which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth alſo an externall Eccleſiaſticall fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and communion in exhorting, reproving, comforting and edifying of all, and bindeth us to offer prayers and thankſgivings to God in the Miniſtry of the Church, in behalfe of all the Churches of the whole world; to reduce Churches gone aſtray, &amp;c. and that fellowſhip which the members of a particular Church
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119921:26"/> hold amongſt themſelves, the ſame in a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion ought the Provinciall and Nationall Churches to hold amongſt themſelves, for the mutuall edification and increaſe of the body of Chriſt, by which Eccleſiaſticall communion all Nationall Churches doe make up one Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Eccleſiaſticall body.</p>
               <p n="3">3. So alſo we ſee in Scripture Eccleſiaſticall meetings held, which repreſented the Church Catholike and Univerſall of the whole world; wherein buſineſſes were tranſacted which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the Univerſall Catholike Church of the whole world: as <hi>Act.</hi> 1. where an Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call meeting is held by Preaching the Word, and exerciſes of Diſcipline or Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16, 26. and that in the name of the Church Catholike: for there are the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours of the Church Catholike, the Apoſtles (ſent into the whole world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19.) with the brethren out of Galilee and Jeruſalem <hi>ver.</hi> 15. and they tranſact a buſineſſe which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the Church Univerſall, to wit, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of an Apoſtle to be a Paſtor of the Church Univerſall. And they who tranſact thoſe things which concern the rule, government, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of the Church Univerſall, ought to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Church of the whole world. And <hi>All.</hi> 15. 22. that meeting of Apoſtles, Elders, and Brethren is called <hi>a Church,</hi> who by an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power preſcribed Eccleſiaſticall decrees and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119921:27"/> canons to all the Churches of the Gentiles, and impoſed them in a way of Juriſdiction, which no Provinciall, or Nationall, much leſſe Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiall Church might lawfully do; but is an act of the Catholike Church.</p>
               <p>The Reformed Divines alſo acknowledge a Catholike viſible Church: ſee (amongſt others) <hi>Walaeus</hi> in his common places, <hi>loco de Eccleſia militante, pag.</hi> 458. of his works <hi>in folio;</hi> where, explaining the nature of the Church viſible, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the definition of it, he affirmes, that <hi>this Church viſible is conſidered two wayes; either <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally, for the Church which through the whole world is by the preaching of the Gospell cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of the world, which in ſome respect may be called alſo Catholike; or for a Particular compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny confined to one certain place.</hi> See alſo the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of the Profeſſours of Leyden, <hi>diſp. 40. theſ.</hi> 27. where they tell us, that the <hi>Church Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible is by ſome conſounded with a Church Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and the Inviſible with the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall; But we,</hi> ſay they, <hi>ſaving alwayes better judgements, think<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> theſe members ought not to be confounded.</hi> And <hi>theſ.</hi> 33. thus they ſay, <hi>This Church viſible is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered two wayes, either as a certaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> company of one particular village, towne, or province, thoſe, to wit, who are knit together not only in a community of Faith and Sacraments, but alſo in the forme of externall Government and Eccleſiasticall rites: or as a certaine company Occumenicall and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119921:27"/> disperſed in divers places through the whole world, though in the very externall forme of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and circumſtantiall rites, they doe often much differ amongſt themſelves, yet agreeing in the eſſentiall communitie of the Faith and Sacraments: whence alſo that is frequent in</hi> Cyprian, <hi>The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick is one, whereof each ſeverally hold a part.</hi>

We affirme that a company of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters met together with Eccleſiaſticall juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction for tranſacting Church affaires, are a Church; to wit, a miniſteriall, or a governing and repreſentative Church, (as they call it;) and therefore called in Scripture by the name <hi>Church.</hi> We confeſſe that ſuch a company of Presbyters are not a Church Repreſentative properly ſo called; as if the Elders were the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates of the beleevers, who in their name and their ſtead governe the Church, and judge of Church affaires; ſo as that the company of beleevers governe and judge by thoſe Elders as their inſtruments and deputies: like as the Kings deputy repreſents the King himſelfe. For the multitude of Beleevers in the Church hath not by the Word of God a power of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and judging Church affaires by a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all juriſdiction, and therefore cannot delegate it to the Elders and Presbyters: But the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters doe themſelves immediately from Chriſt the King of the Church receive power of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119921:28"/> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. In this ſenſe therefore we doe not acknowledge a repreſentative Church. Neither doe we acknowledge ſuch a Repreſentative Church, as by commiſſion from the multitude of beleevers, ſhould have abſolute power by their lawes and acts of juriſdiction to bind the multitude, and ſubject their faith and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo as without triall they ſhould receive and imbrace what ſoever ſhould be determined by this Church. For this is the Papiſts tyrannicall Antichriſtian repreſentative Church, in the Pope and his popiſh Biſhops, which by Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches is denied and caſt out: But this repreſentative Church we acknowledge out of the holy Scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi> a company of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters choſen by the multitude of the Church, which by authority and eccleſiaſticall juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction received from Chriſt is ſet over and takes care of the Church, and rules it by ſpirituall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and decrees made conſonant to the Word of God; to whom the whole multitude of beleevers is bound to yeeld obedience, in all things which from the Word of God and by the power by Chriſt committed to them they decree. This governing miniſteriall or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative Church is proved by theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From <hi>Matth. 18, 17, 18. Tell the Church</hi> This is that Church which hath the power o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

But now this power was not given to the whole multitude of beleevers, but to the Elders and Governours of the Church, who muſt be obeyed in the Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the penalty of Excommunication.

                  </gap>, the Rulers and Guides in the Church. This is that Church which is to receive and judge of the beleevers complaints brought before them, concerning the ſcandals and offences of the members of the Church: which is the office of the Paſtours and Presbyters, to whom the Holy Ghoſt hath preſcribed lawes and rules, according to which they ought to receive and judge of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 13. which to all the multitude of beleevers in the Church is not injoyned. This is that Church-which hath the power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting and retaining ſins; which was given to the Apoſtles and their Succeſſours, <hi>Matth. 16. 18, 19.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119921:29"/> place expound <hi>Church,</hi> by <hi>Church Governors, who as it were repreſent the whole Church,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 28. 2 Cor. 2. 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It's proved from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. where is an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall aſſembly deſcribed, which by a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall juriſdiction tranſacts the Church affairs, and repreſents the Church, to wit, the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery taking care of the Church diſcipline, which is gathered together with <hi>Pauls</hi> mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall ſpirit, and the power of the Lord Ieſus, that is, the power of the Keys, which Chriſt, as Lord of his Church, only hath, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 7. which therefore conſiſteth only of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Miniſters, and Chriſts Embaſſadors, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they who alone have the miniſteriall ſpirit of the Apoſtles, and the power of the Lord committed to them: which is allſo gathered together for this end, to deliver to Sathan an inceſtuous perſon, a Church member: which exerciſe is committed not to all the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members, but to the Miniſters and Paſtors. We muſt therefore acknowledge a governing and repreſentative Church.</p>
               <q>We reject therefore theſe oppoſite opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions following.</q>
               <p n="1">1. That there is no other Church viſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in Scripture, but a particular or paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiall Church, which might meet together in one place to celebrate the holy worſhip of God. For there is ſuch a viſible Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:119921:30"/> in Scripture, which hath thoſe attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes given to it, which agree not to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, as ſuch: as that it's diſperſed through <hi>Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Aſia and Bithinia. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 1. compared with chap. 5. 1, 2. that all both Jewes and Greeks, whether bond or free make up one body thereof. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That a particular viſible Church is by the Word of God limited to ſuch bounds, as that of neceſſity they may be ordinarily contained, and ought to meet in one place for performing the publike worſhip of God with mutuall edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For we have ſhewed that the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a Church, as by reaſon of their mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude or ſome other cauſe, cannot ordinarily meet in one place, doth well agree with the word of God and Apoſtolicall inſtitution. For the eſſence and lawfull conſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a Church dependeth not on the outward circumſtance of place, but on a due Profeſſion of faith, and bond of holy communion. For, as <hi>Ames</hi> ſaith, <hi>that ſame in Profeſſion doth constitute a Church Viſible, which in Reality and it's internall nature conſtituteth the Church Mysticall, that is, Faith. Medull. lib. 1. cap. 32. theſ.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there is no viſible inſtituted Church, but that which is met together for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of all the Eccleſiaſticall ordinances of Chriſt, for preaching the word of God, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119921:30"/> adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of all the offices and ſpirituall gifts, in a conſtituted Church. But Chriſt ſpeaketh of a Church (<hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17.) met together not for the word and Sacraments, but only for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Church Diſcipline. So likewiſe is that meeting called a Church, wherein the Apoſtles did not by way of Sermon preach the word, nor adminiſter the Sacraments, but only told what God had done among the Gentiles. <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 27. &amp; 15. 4. or choſe ſome to carry their decrees to others. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 22. which were acts of Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction. And therefore that meeting, which meeteth only for the exerciſe of diſcipline and Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, is allſo a Church, and ſo called in Scripture.</p>

               <p>VVHether the Eccleſiaſticall power, or power of the keyes, be given by Chriſt to the multitude or all the members of a Church as the firſt and immediate ſubject: ſo as believers not bearing any Church office may by themſelves immediately exerciſe all Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, diſcipline, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Eccleſiaſticall, ſave only the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.

               <p>
                  <label>Anſwer.</label>
               </p>
               <p>THe Reformed Divines teach that none in the Church of Chriſt, which is his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, may arrogate any power to himſelfe, but from a divine calling and delegation from Chriſt: for whereas thoſe Eccleſiaſticall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires are adminiſtred in the Church in the name of Chriſt and with his power, none may performe them but he to whom they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 1. and 5. 4. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 20. and when as Chriſt hath vouchſafed this calling and delegation to adminiſter thoſe holy functions not to all in the Church, but
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:119921:31"/> to ſome only, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 28, 29. Rom.</hi> 12. 4, 5, 6. they therefore deny that this power belongeth to all. They allow indeed to all beleevers and godly members in the Church viſible a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all dignity and authority of Grace, whereby they are Kings and Prieſts to God (for divine Grace hath a heavenly authority and majeſtie accompanying it) but deny, that authority of Office, and Eccleſiaſticall power or juriſdiction belongeth to them all.</p>
               <q>We grant in this controverſie.</q>
               <p n="1">1. That the power of the Keyes is given by Chriſt for the benefit of the whole Church, and of all beleevers, for their ſpirituall edification, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11, 12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That to all the members of the Church belongeth power to chooſe their Miniſters and Paſtours, either by ſuffrages, or by free conſent. For this power is found grounded on rules of holy Scripture, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 23. and 6. 2, 3, 4. &amp; 14. 22. But by this Election the beleevers doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre or derive the power of the Keyes on the Miniſters or Paſtours choſen; but only deſigne him, on whom the power of that Church office is, by divine Inſtitution, to be conferred, by Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Ordination. The whole derivation of Eccleſiaſticall authority and ſpirituall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on Miniſters (ſo farre as it can be miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, ſecondarily, and ſubordinately performed by the Church) is by the whole Eccleſiaſticall
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:119921:32"/> 
                  <hi>Vocation.</hi> But by <hi>Election</hi> is only the deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the perſon on whom that power is to be conferred: and by <hi>Ordination</hi> he is authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively ſent, and put into poſſeſſion of that fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to which he was by Election deſigned to be ordained. Ordination therefore is an act of Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, as the Biſhop of <hi>Spalato</hi> righly diſcourſeth, <hi>De repub. eccleſ. lib. 2. cap. 3. num.</hi> 54. but the act of Election or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination is not an act of juriſdiction or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall authority, but of the gift of diſcretion; whereby they prove the ſpirits, and diſcern the voice of the ſhepheard, and chooſe him by whoſe teaching they will be lead.</p>
               <p>For the better clearing of this buſineſſe. When we conſider of a Paſtors Calling intirely and abſolutely, and not in reference to ſome part of it, by it is the whole derivation of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall right, on this or that perſon perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And thus it comprehendeth <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Ordination.</hi> Election hath three parts, <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, Approbation,</hi> and <hi>Nomination.</hi> Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination conſiſts in the triall of his Learning, and Gifts, and former Converſation. Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lieth in two things, Judgement, and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Judgement we call that ſentence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the perſon examined is judged fit to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Miniſtery, and may profitably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it. Aſſent is of them who reſt ſatiſfied in this judgement. Nomination is when one by
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119921:32"/> name is by common adviſe decerned to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to the Miniſtery of a Church. Ordination comprehendeth <hi>Miſſion</hi> and <hi>Admiſſion.</hi> Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (or ſending) is an authoritative act of the Presbytery, whereby the Office is conferred on the perſon elected, and he ſent and commended to the Church for which he had been deſigned, and put in poſſeſſion of his Miniſtery. Initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (or Admiſſion) is the publike adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an outward rite, wherby the perſon ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted is eſtabliſhed in the miniſtery of that Church, and is performed by explaining the divine Inſtitution, Prayer, and a ſolemne bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: the common Symbol of this Ordination is Impoſition of hands. In this whole buſineſſe therefore of <hi>Vocation,</hi> we grant to the people <hi>Nomination;</hi> which was at firſt in the power of the Presbyters and people in common: The Governours of the Church meane while mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the whole action; for they being better able to judge of the quality of their learning and gifts, were therefore to performe this charge, that according to the canons they were not to follow the people, but to leade them: for the Election was chiefly the act of Miniſters, the worke of the faithfull people to conſent to that Election: <hi>diſtinct. 63. cap. Noſſe, &amp; cap. Cum longè.</hi> For it is cleare by Apoſtolicall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and the practiſe of the Ancients, that the Miniſters were firſt to Nominate; and the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:119921:33"/> people to aſſent to that Nomination duly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, or to conſult in common about the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be nominated, or laſtly, if they have any cauſe why they might juſtly oppoſe that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, freely to produce their judgement to the Governours of the Church. Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they ſignified anciently (as <hi>Junius</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth <hi>diſput. 38. Anni 1604. de poteſt. Eccleſiaſt. theſ.</hi> 14.) either by lifting up their hands, or in ſilence approving the Judgement of the Church. An Aſſenting ſuffrage was called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. The <hi>Examination</hi> was performed by learned &amp; grave men choſen out of the Presbytery of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, or Colledge of Doctors, for this worke; for to theſe above others is this care co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 2. Act.</hi> 20. 30. And for the <hi>Judgement</hi> of the Examinates ſufficiencie and learning, that this did chiefly belong to thoſe that labour in the Word, is without doubt, for the ſpirits of the Prophets muſt be ſubject to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 32. The <hi>Aſſent</hi> is of the whole Church, whereby they acquieſce and reſt in the Judgement of the Examiners and thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Examination. But that this is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required before proceeding to <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is a thing manifeſt. All this buſineſſe of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection</hi> doth not conſtitute any one a Paſtour; but doth judge and declare that perſon to be fit, and ſufficiently endued with gifts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeth
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:119921:33"/> by common conſent that he ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to the miniſtery, that the dignity of the Paſtorall office may according to the order of Chriſt be conferred on him. For the Peoples <hi>Nomination,</hi> and the whole matter of <hi>Election</hi> may be rightly performed, and yet it may ſo come to paſſe that he which is choſen by a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may never be their Paſtor: to wit, if the perſon elected do juſtly refuſe it; or the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery duly determine the Perſon elected to be unfit for the Miniſtery of this people. But by <hi>Ordination</hi> if a man be Eccleſiaſtically ſent forth and ſeparated for the Miniſtery, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3. and the power of the Miniſtery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 2. 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 14. and he put into poſſeſſion of the Miniſtery, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. This being a poteſtative act of Eccleſiaſticall authority, is every where in Scripture attributed to thoſe who have Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall authority: to wit, to the Presbytery, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 14. to the Prophets and Teachers that miniſtred, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3. to the Paſtors and Miniſters of the Church, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. &amp; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. whence allſo in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God commanded, that by Moſes an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Prophet ſhould ſacrifices be o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119921:34"/> was by <hi>Nathan</hi> annointed to be Prieſt. And <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. 10. by impoſition of hands of the Elders, and the Firſt-borne, who enjoyed an Eccleſiaſticall function, are the Levits put into their office. <hi>Ordination</hi> therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines in it the <hi>Poteſtative Miſſion,</hi> whereby according to divine appointment a Paſtor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth the Eccleſiaſticall Office. Which <hi>Miſſion</hi> (or ſending) is ſo neceſſary, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it no man may duly undertake an Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall office. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We grant that there are ſome acts of Eccleſiaſticall government which by the word of God may not be performed without the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement &amp; conſent of the Church. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in excommunication of a Member in a Church: private beleevers are by the word of God to exhort and reprove offending brethren, to complaine to the Church of the obſtinate, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15, 16. And, by the law of charity, as they are brethren in Chriſt, to admoniſh their Governors if remiſſe and negligent, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 17. to avoid a perſon excommunicate as a heathen and publican, <hi>Tit. 3. 10. Mat.</hi> 18. 17. to reprove him as a brother, 2 <hi>Theſ. 3. 14, 15. &amp;c.</hi> All which manifeſtly require an aſſent of the people to the excommunication of an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding brother. The Exerciſe of Eccleſiaſticall power, to preach the word, to adminiſter the Sacraments of the Covenant, to retain &amp; remit
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:119921:34"/> ſinnes, is given to the Church Rulers in ſome things (called commonly the Power <hi>of Order</hi>) ſeverally and a part conſidered, as ſingle Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors. So a Paſtor may preach the word, and adminiſter the Sacraments, without ſpeciall conſent either of the whole Church or of the Governours to every act. In other things (as in the uſe of the Power of <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> or <hi>Excommunication</hi>) the exerciſe and power thereof is given to an Unity, not to One; to the community of the Governors of the Church, not to ſingle Paſtors ſeverally; for in the Church, one ſingle man hath not power of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call diſcipline. If a Paſtor alone do excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate any one, that excommunication is inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide, as well at the tribunall of Chriſt, as of the Church: but if one Paſtor alone, do baptiſe a perſon without an Aſſent of the Church, that Baptiſme is valide. The government of the Church or Kingdome of Chriſt is Free and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, to which all the children of the Church do voluntarily ſubmit themſelves: but yet it is a Government, properly ſo called, for there is in it Authoritative Iuriſdiction, and Eccleſiaſticall coaction by ſpirituall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the Soule. In reference to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, (that this Government is voluntarie) the whole people by their free and voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and agreement do concurre to the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Governors of the Church, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119921:35"/> of Members. But, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the latter, (that the Government of the Church is properly Government) the whole people doth not rule or governe in the Church; but the Church is divided into Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and thoſe that are Ruled: and therefore only the Guides and Rulers of Churches in Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction are Chriſts vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents, to rule and in his name to command, to judge and by Church cenſures to correct: the power of Eccleſiaſticall office hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the government of the Church, over and above the peoples conſent, an authoritative and coactive power of the diſcipline and rodde of Chriſt, which belongeth not to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>We deny therefore in this controverſy, that there belongeth to the brotherhood, or body of beleevers in the Church, an authoritative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, wherby they may joine with the Elder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <q>We maintaine therefore in this cauſe theſe following aſſertions:</q>
               <p n="1">I. That the Power of the Keyes, and the exerciſe thereof in a conſtituted Church, is not by Chriſt given to the Brotherhood, or People in a Church, but to the Presbytery &amp; thoſe that have the overſight of Churches, or the Paſtors
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:119921:35"/> and Ruling Elders only. This Aſſertion is proved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe that Office which doth eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally contain the power and exerciſe of the Keys, is not common to all beleevers in a Church, but to ſome ſpecifically, choſen for it, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 28. Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11, 12. To <hi>Apoſtles, Paſtors, &amp;c.</hi> as ſuch, is the power of the Keys given, <hi>Ioh. 20. 21, 22, 23. 2 Cor. 5. 20. 1 Tim.</hi> 5. 17. Therefore to thoſe onely, and not to all beleevers doth this power belong. For to thoſe hath God given the power of the Keys, who are ſtewards of the myſteries of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. who are Servants in the houſe of God by ſpeciall office, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5. who know how to behave themſelves aright in the houſe of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. and to give to thoſe in the houſe their due portion in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 25. rightly to divide and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the word of God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15. For the <hi>Keyes</hi> are a ſigne of power intruſted, which are by Chriſt committed to the ſtewards and overſeers in his houſe, whereby to adminiſter their power. And by the <hi>Keyes</hi> in Scripture is ſignified, authority, faculty, power, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of government, which is exerciſed in commanding, forbidding, allowing, reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: As <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. 22. compared with <hi>Iſa. 9. 6. Rev.</hi> 1. 18. &amp; 3. 7. And <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18, 19. denotes Miniſters power and full adminiſtration. They
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119921:36"/> are committed therefore to thoſe who are ſet over the Church, not to all in the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That opinion is not to be admitted, which doth overthrow the order conſtituted by Chriſt in the Church: by which order, Chriſt hath in the Church viſible, as in an Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Organical Body conſtituted of divers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrall parts, to which he hath given their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar functions and operations in that Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall body. For he hath ſet in the Church, eyes, eares, hands, feet, rulers, and ſuch as are over them in the Lord, overſeers, watchmen, Paſtors, Embaſſadors in Chriſts name, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, fathers, builders, ſowers, &amp;c. And, a flock, a people, a houſe, a field, children, and ſuch as governed, and who are bound to obey thoſe that are ſet over them &amp;c. ſee <hi>Heb. 13. 17. 1 Theſ. 5. 12. 1 Tim. 5. 17. 2 Cor. 5. 20. 1 Cor. 4. 1, 2, 15. 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 9. &amp;c. But if all in the Church have the power of the Keys, power of building, ruling the Church by cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures Eccleſiaſticall, &amp;c. all will be Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, Rulers, Fathers, Paſtors, Watchmen, Eyes, Eares, for to thoſe parts of the Church do Eccleſiaſticall and authoritative overſight and rule belong, as their proper function: Therefore the power of the Keys and exerciſe thereof is not common to all members of a Church, but is the proper function of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers and Paſtors, to whom the Rod and that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:119921:36"/> ſevere power is committed for the edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 21. 2 Cor.</hi> 13. 10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Cannons and rules propoſed in holy Scripture, whereby the right government of the Church, and the due uſe of the Keyes is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, are not given to all the beleevers in a Church; but the Paſtors and Elders, <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and other Church-Governors are by the Apoſtle inſtructed, how to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the houſe of God, as faithfull ſtewards; in the Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and alſo 1 <hi>Cor. chap.</hi> 3. &amp;. 4. And the faults which are committed in miſ-governing of Churches, and abuſe of the Keys, are not by God imputed as the fault of all the beleevers in a Church, but of ſome, to wit the overſeers, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 4, 5, 6. Tit. 1. 7. 1 Pet. 5. 3. Revel. 2. 14, 20. 3. Ioh.</hi> 16. 10. The praiſe and reward promiſed for due ordering of Churches, is not by God promiſed to all the beleevers in a Church, but to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Elders who rule well in the Lord, 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. 12. Heb. 13. 17. 1 Tim. 5. 17. 2 Tim. 4. 4, 5. 1 Pet. 5. 4, 5. Revel.</hi> 22. Therefore to thoſe only is the Government of Churches, and the exerciſe of the Keys intruſted by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To whom Chriſt gave the power and exerciſe of the Keys, or Rule in the Church, to thoſe he gave the ſpirit for adminiſtration, and thoſe gifts which are neceſſary for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119921:37"/> of the Church: For when God ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth any into his Church, he alwayes qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them with gifts ſufficient and fit for the exerciſe of that miniſtery and office commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them; as is evident by the examples of all, whom God hath ſent into the Church. But where is the Spirit promiſed to all, whereby all the beleevers in a Church may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and retaine ſinnes, ſpoken of <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20, 21, 22, 23. Where is that prudence and wiſdome promiſed to all, whereby they may be able to rule the houſe of God, to go in and out before the people of God? &amp;c. Therefore the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, and the exerciſe of the Keys is not by God committed to all.</p>
               <p>Hence alſo have the Reformed Churches alwayes rejected a popular Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; See <hi>Sadeel's</hi> treatiſe in French, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline, againſt <hi>Morel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius:</hi> Of whom Reverend <hi>Beza, (libro de Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrorum gradibus, cap.</hi> 25.) when he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the manner of Election in the Church, ſaith thus, <hi>which order by the goodneſſe of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly and prudently obſerved hitherto in this City, when one democraticall fanaticall</hi> Morelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us <hi>of</hi> Paris <hi>was bold by word and writing to find fault with, that his writing was both in this Church and in</hi> France <hi>in many Synods worthily condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> And in our Synodicall conſtitutions the Churches Eccleſiaſticall power, Judgement,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119921:37"/> Exerciſe of the Keys, and Church-government, is every where committed to the Paſtors &amp; El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to Presbyteries, Conſiſtories, Claſſes, and Synods. See the Synod at Embden: <hi>Anno</hi> 1571. from <hi>Article</hi> 25. to <hi>art.</hi> 35. At Dort. <hi>Anno 1578. art.</hi> 92. to <hi>art.</hi> 101. at Middleburgh, <hi>Anno 1581. art.</hi> 58. to <hi>art.</hi> 66. at the Hagh, <hi>Anno 1586. art.</hi> 64. to <hi>art.</hi> 74. at Middleburgh, <hi>Anno 1591. art.</hi> 58. to 75. at Dort. <hi>Anno 1619. art.</hi> 71. to <hi>art.</hi> 81.</p>
               <p n="2">II. We affirm that the power of ſending or ordaining Paſtors or Church-Governors is committed by God in a ſetled Church, not to the multitude of the Church, but to the Paſtors and Elders or Presbyters of Churches. We grant indeed (as was ſaid before) that there is a liberty of nomination or election allowed by the word of God to all the members in a Church, ſo as no Miniſter may without the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement and conſent of the people be obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon a Church, whether they will or no: which Nomination or Election doth not yet confer Miniſterial power on the perſon elected, but only deſigneth a Perſon on whom it may be duly derived according to the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted rule, by thoſe who have under Chriſt received that power, whereby Eccleſiaſticall authority is derived on this or that perſon. We deny not alſo but that extraordinarily in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and depraved eſtate of a whole viſible
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:119921:38"/> Church, the multitude or faithfull people in a Church may chooſe their Paſtors and Rulers, and authoritatively put them into the power, right and poſſeſſion of the Miniſtery; and that by reaſon of a cogent neceſſity which admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no law, and to which all poſitive law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth place. But we affirm that in a ſetled and conſtituted viſible Church, the people by the poſitive law of God have not power of ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or ſending their Paſtors: but that pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtative Miſſion &amp; Ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whereby Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall authority or the Miniſteriall power is conferred on this or that man deſigned to the Miniſtery, belongeth to Presbyteries. Our aſſertion is proved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From thoſe precepts deſcribed in holy Scripture concerning Ordination or Sending Rulers to a Church, whereby it is committed not to the multitude of beleevers, but to the Elders and Church-Governors, 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 22. 2 Tim. 2. 2. Tit.</hi> 1. 5. &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the Examples of the Apoſtolick Church, wherein the power of ſending and ordaining Paſtors was reſerved to Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, and never committed to the people. See examples, <hi>Act. 6. 6. Act. 13. 1, 2, 3. 1 Tim. 4. 14. 2 Tim.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe the power of ſuſpenſion or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading Miniſters of a Church belongeth not to the Multitude: For to whom belongs the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:119921:38"/> authority of taking away an Eccleſiaſticall Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, to the ſame it belongeth to conferre it; for in what way any thing is obtained, in the ſame way it is diſſolved: But no where in Scripture is this committed to the people, to paſſe an Eccleſiaſticall cenſure, on falſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or Teachers, or remove them from the Miniſtery; but is required of the Angels of Churches, and their Presbyters, <hi>Tit. 1. 10, 13. Reve. 2. 2, 14, 15, 16, 20. Act.</hi> 20. 28, 29.</p>
               <p>So alſo is it decreed by our Belgick Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that the Election of Paſtors and Elders be not tranſacted without the peoples ſuffrages or free aſſent; yet that the Miſſion or Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the Miniſtery of a Church, as alſo the ſuſpenſion and degradation of a Miniſter be done by the Conſiſtoriall Presbitery upon the judgement and aſſent of the Claſſis. See the Canons of the Synod at Middleburgh, <hi>Anno. 1591. art.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 11, 58. at the Hagh, <hi>Anno. 1586. art.</hi> 4, 13, 72. at Middleburgh, <hi>Anno. 1581. art.</hi> 4, 7, 64. at Dort. <hi>Anno. 1619. art.</hi> 4, 5, 79.</p>
               <q>We reject therfore theſe contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons following.</q>
               <p n="1">I. Of thoſe who aſcribe to the people or multitude of beleevers, the power of the Keys, even where there are no Rulers or Governors, ſo that a Congregation of beleevers joyned in Church-Covenant, though wanting Church
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:119921:39"/> Governors, hath power of excommunication, and of exerciſing all acts of the Keys, or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall juriſdiction and government, ſave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Sacraments. But to us it is certaine from the word of God, that that Church to which Chriſt gave the power of the Keys, and the exerciſe of Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, is an Organicall body of divers members, wherein are Eyes, Eares, Hands, and Feet: Paſtors, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and a Flock, which is lead and governed, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 14, 15. Rom. 12. 4, 5. 6. Act.</hi> 20. 28, 29. But now beleevers joyned in Church Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, deſtitute of Church Rulers, doe not make up ſuch an organicall body. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore never in Scripture do we meet with a Church, which exerciſed Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and the power of the Keys, and yet was deſtitute of Church Rulers; See 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 4. Act. 20. 28, 29. Revel. chap. 2. and</hi> 3. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to no Church of beleevers, wanting Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, are we to aſcribe the Keys of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Of thoſe who affirme that the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a Church doth derive Eccleſiaſticall power on the Church-Governors, and the Church-Governors are the beleevers ſervants properly ſo called, the Churches mouth, hand, and inſtruments, by whoſe intervention ſhe doth execute her decrees, ſo that the Church of beleevers, under Chriſt the Lord and Head
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:119921:39"/> of the Church, as his ſpouſe and wife doth communicate government, ſtewardſhip, and legall exerciſe of Iuriſdiction, to ſome certaine men choſen by her ſelfe, who as her ſervants and deputies, by an authority borrowed from the multitude, as the firſt and immediate ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Eccleſiaſticall authority, do govern the houſe of God, and exerciſe the chiefe acts of their function. But we in this cauſe do from the holy Scriptures thus judge;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That all the Functions, and Offices, and their authority, are inſtituted by Chriſt in the Church and Houſe of God; and that the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the Church do derive and receive the offices which they beare, and their power and authority, not from men but from Chriſt alone and his inſtitution. <hi>Epheſ. 4. 11, 12. 1 Cor. 12. 26, 27, 28, 29. Act.</hi> 20. 28. and that the power of the Keys and all authority of order and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is primarily in Chriſt; which Chriſt doth immediatly communicate to his Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors therein.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the multitude of beleevers in a Church, by this nomination or deſignation of a perſon, on whom it may, according to Chriſts inſtitution, be duly conferred, doth effect thus much; that the Eccleſiaſticall office and the power thereof, by the donation of Chriſt, may be applyed to this or that man; but doth not derive this power on that perſon. But the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:119921:40"/> Presbytery of Churches by a poteſtative Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or authoritative Ordination and impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hands, doth apply and ſend forth that perſon deſigned by the peoples choice, into the poſſeſſion and exerciſe of that function and authority. So that Church Offices and their authority is immediatly from Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on the Church Governors: but the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of theſe Offices to theſe or thoſe men, is done by the poteſtative Miſſion of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, with the previous aſſent or nomination of the people,</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Paſtors therfore in the execution of all acts of their office, are not the Churches ſervants, properly called, but Governors, Guides, Fathers, Rulers in the Church, to whom the people are bound to obey, whoſe Government, Rod, and authority they ought to ſubmit to and imbrace with due ſubjection and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <hi>Heb. 13. 17. 1 Theſ. 5. 12, 13. 1 Cor.</hi> 4. 1. And therfore when they are called the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> of the faithfull, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5. they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by that name, not <hi>ſubjectivè,</hi> as if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived and held their authority fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church, for then were they the ſervants of men not of God: but <hi>finaliter</hi> or <hi>objectivè,</hi> becauſe they are the ſervants of God for the Church, for whoſe good and benefit they labour. As Chriſt is called our ſervant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 28. and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells are called miniſtring Spirits, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119921:40"/> Yet neither Chriſt nor the Angells have the authority of their vocation from us, but exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it for our good and ſervice. The Church Officers therfore are ſervants, but ſervants of God and of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. in whoſe name they are Embaſſadours in all the acts of their Eccleſiaſticall functions, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. and are furniſhed with his commands, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18. are his Angells, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 1. and ſtewards in his houſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1, 2, &amp; 3, 10.</p>
               <p n="3">III. We reject alſo the oppoſite opinion of thoſe, who teach, that the exerciſe of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication cannot be duly and lawfully done, but by the judgement and decree of the people; ſo as the whole multitude of the Church be the Judge in the caſe of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. Although we grant that no man may in the Church be duly excommunicated without the knowledge and againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the people, but that the Exerciſe of the greater Excommunication ought to be with the aſſent of the whole people, as was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Yet to ſet all the Church members in the places of Judges, we certainly beleeve would bring anarchy and confuſion into the Church. And our aſſertion is proved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 17, 18. where the Keys of the Kingdome of Heaven are promiſed to <hi>Peter,</hi> as a Paſtor, and ordinary Ruler of the Church of God; for to thoſe is promiſed the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:119921:41"/> power of binding and looſing, of retaining and remitting ſinnes, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. which authority is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to Chriſts Embaſſadours, whom he ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth into the world with his authority, <hi>Joh. 20. 20, 21, 22. 2 Cor. 5. 19, 20.</hi> To thoſe therefore is the exerciſe of the Keyes in Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion intruſted; and not to the whole people, to whom they are not promiſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From <hi>Matth. 18. 17, 18.</hi> We have ſhewed before, that this place is to be underſtood of a Church repreſentative, or Company of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; to whom Chriſt hath given power, whereby they actually caſt out the ſcandalous and obſtinate, as heathens and publicans, from Church-communion: which power is not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the multitude of beleevers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our aſſertion is evident from 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 4, 5. You</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and my ſpirit being gathered together in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with the power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let ſuch a man be delivered to Satan:</hi> and this <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke</hi> or Church cenſure, was done <gap reason="foreign">

Hence <hi>Bullinger</hi> on that place 1 <hi>Cor. 5.</hi> doth thus comment; <hi>Therefore the ancient Church had a holy Senate of Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which did diligently admoniſh offenders in the Church, ſharply correct them; yea, and exclude them from Church fellowſhip, to wit, if it appeared that no amendment might be expected.</hi> And <hi>Hype<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> noteth upon this place, <hi>That by Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt not ſimply be underſtood, the whole mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, amongſt whom are mingled many Jewes, Ananias's, falſe brethren, men vitious, who would never ſuffer that ſuch a ſentence ſhould be unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly paſſed; but rather certaine ſelected Elders, eminent for learning and piety, in whoſe power he

               </p>
               <p>WHether the end and effect of the work of the Eccleſiaſticall Miniſtery be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Confirmation and Edification of thoſe Church-members who are already converted and truly godly; ſo as that Paſtours are not more obliged by vertue of their Eccleſiaſticall function to convert the ſtraying ſoules of ſuch as live in the world, and in ſins out of Church-communion; then all beleevers indued with
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:119921:42"/> the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, are by the common duty of Charity bound to doe?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſwer.</label>
               </p>
               <p>WE judge that the Word of God duly and truly preached, and publikely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, is both a meanes of conſtituting a Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, and a note of a true Viſible Church; and a meanes alſo of confirming and ſaving of beleevers, who doe already in a viſible Church profeſſe the Faith.</p>
               <p>We grant in this Queſtion. 1. That private Chriſtians from the common duty of Charity, making uſe of thoſe ſpirituall gifts which they have received from God for mens edification, doe ſometimes convert to the faith thoſe ſouls which went aſtray; and bring thoſe, who live in the world out of the Church, unto the body of the Church of Chriſt. See <hi>John 4. 29.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>1 Cor. 7. 16.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. We doe not think, that the office of him who preacheth the Word, as ſent of God and the Church, doth conferre any efficacie to the Word preached by him; or hath any influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the ſoule of him that is converted. For the power of God only, and the Spirit which accompanieth the Word preached, doth give to the Word preached a vertue and ſaving efficacy for the Converſion and Salvation of ſoules, <hi>1 Cor. 12. 11.</hi> &amp; 15. 10. But we affirme
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:119921:43"/> that the Word preached by him, who is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to an Eccleſiaſticall Office, and doth, by his Eccleſiaſticall Office, authoritatively preach the Word, is the ordinary meanes, to which God doth by the Efficacy of his Spirit give aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, for the Converſion of thoſe who live in ſinne out of Church-communion. So that Paſtours, as Paſtours, by vertue of their Paſtorall Office are the ordinary meanes of the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thoſe men who live in the world.</p>
               <q>This Aſſertion is proved:</q>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe Faith is given and firſt attained by the Word preached, by thoſe who by an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall call are ſent of God, to the Paſtorall Office, and by vertue of miſſion and function preach the Word, whereby faith is wrought in man. See <hi>Rom. 10. 14, 15. 1 Cor. 3. 19. Gal. 3. 2.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe Paſtours of Churches by reaſon of the Office they beare, are Fathers, who doe firſt beget their children to Chriſt in the Church; and by the ſpirituall ſeed of God, do give ſpirit and life to thoſe that are dead in ſins: See <hi>1 Cor. 4. 15. Gal. 4. 19. 2 Cor. 2. 16.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Paſtours are injoyned, as an Office pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly belonging to them, to preach the Word of God with all meekneſſe, mildneſſe, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if perhaps God will give repentance to thoſe who are held captives in the ſhares of the devill, <hi>2 Tim. 2. 24, 25, 26.</hi> to open the eyes of thoſe who ſit in darkneſſe, and to bring them to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:119921:43"/> the light of the Goſpel and of Grace, <hi>Act. 26. 18.</hi> to ſeek loſt ſheep for the Lord, <hi>Ezek. 34. 4, 5.</hi> and to bring into captivitie to the obedience of Chriſt, thoſe who with high minds exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the Word of God, <hi>2 Cor. 10. 4, 5.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We reject therefore the oppoſite Poſitions of thoſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Who affirme, that the Converſion of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, is not an effect intended, that it ſhould be produced by vertue of the Eccleſiaſticall Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, as a meanes appointed to that end; and therefore that never any are converted by the Paſtours of the Church by vertue of any Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Office, but, by accident, as they are gifted Chriſtians: affirming that ordinarily the Converſion of ſuch as goe aſtray is by ſuch Chriſtians indued with gifts of Propheſie. But it is certaine from the holy Scripture, that the Eccleſiaſticall Miniſtery is appointed by God for this end, as the ordinary meanes whereby ſuch as are ſtrangers and enemies to God may be reconciled, <hi>2 Cor. 5. 20.</hi> and brought to Chriſt, <hi>2 Cor. 11. 2, 3, 4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Of thoſe who affirme, that ſincere Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of men, is a certaine argument, that thoſe by whoſe preaching the Word they are converted, are <hi>ſent</hi> of God, according to that <hi>Rom. 10. 14, 15. Jer. 23. 32.</hi> But we judge that the <hi>ſending</hi> which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14, 15. is a ſending to an office in a due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119921:44"/> whether extraordinary or ordinary, Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtically performed; and that it conſiſteth not only in conferring gifts, whereby a man is made fit for the Miniſtery, or Prophecy, but in conferring authority, and conveying Miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all authority; as the Proteſtants prove by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Arguments againſt the <hi>Socinians.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though private Chriſtians in the duty of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and by reaſon of gifts wherein they are ſubſervient to God, do convert ſome from their ſinnes; yet it followeth not that they are thus ſent, as that they have authority, as the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours of Chriſt, in his Name, to preach the Word of God authoritatively; becauſe they want the Authoritative Miſſion by the Church of Chriſt, wherby that Miniſtery in the Church is conferred, wherein men as the Embaſſadours of Chriſt, preach the Word of Reconciliation, <hi>1 Tim. 4. 14. Tit. 1. 5, 9, 10. 2 Cor. 5. 20.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence alſo our Belgick Reformed Churches acknowledge that Preaching of the Word by Miniſters Eccleſiaſtically called, is the ordinary meanes of mens repentance and firſt Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation to God: as appeareth by the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Forme of eſtabliſhing Paſtours in the Miniſtery of the Church through the whole Netherlands.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Question 2.</label>
               </p>
               <p>Whether the Miniſter of a particular Church
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:119921:44"/> may not only by vertue of his gifts, and from the common duty of Charity, but alſo by vertue of his Eccleſiaſticall Function, lawfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme miniſteriall acts of his office in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Communion of another particular Church, to whoſe ordinary miniſtery he is not called?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſwer.</label>
               </p>
               <p>OUr Judgement in this queſtion is, that he who by an Eccleſiaſticall call is lawfully called, is by vertue of his office not only faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Particular Church, but alſo to the Provinciall, Nationall and Univerſall Church of God; ſo that the Communion of Saints ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to this body of the Church Univerſall; not only by reaſon of the gifts he hath received, but alſo by reaſon of ſpeciall Office which he beareth in the Church; to which he is bound to beſtow and apply the exerciſes and workes of his Office, for the common edification of that whole body. And therefore is bound, by the authority and power of his Eccleſiaſticall Office, to afford ſuccour to the diſtreſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digency of the Church of Chriſt throughout the earth; yet without confuſion and in due order: and there lyeth on all the Paſtours of the Church a Paſtorall charge and care of all the Churches of Chriſt. For to this end did Chriſt appoint Paſtours, and give them to the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119921:45"/> Church for the edification of his body, that all might attaine to the unity of faith, and of the knowledge of the Sonne of God, <hi>Eph. 4. 11, 12. 1 Cor. 12. 24. Rom. 12. 5, 6, 7.</hi> And therefore he may exerciſe the miniſteriall acts of his office not only in one particular Church, but in others alſo, when the edification of thoſe Churches requireth it. We grant indeed that by Election, a Paſtours Miniſtery is reſtrayned by the Word of God to this or that particular Church for his ordinary charge; yet by Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and Miſſion, whereby authority, and Eccleſiaſticall power, and the whole right of the Miniſtery is committed to a man, he is made a Paſtour in the Communion of all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and therefore ought to have a Paſtorall care for the edification of all Churches, and conſequently may exerciſe miniſteriall acts in any viſible Church throughout the world; ſo that it be done without confuſion, and in a due Order.</p>
               <p>This Aſſertion is proved,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the particular Churches of one Province may by Eccleſiaſticall authority ſend forth Paſtours to Nations and people to whom the Goſpel is not yet made knowne; or to other Churches in diſtreſſe or want, who are unſufficient for the Call of their own Paſtors, and working their own Edification: Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this we meet with in the Word of God,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:119921:45"/> 
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3. But this ſending forth of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours is a Miniſteriall act, which is performed by vertue of their Paſtorall Office in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Communion of another particular Church; a Paſtour therefore of one particular Church may exerciſe miniſteriall acts in the Communion of another particular Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Paſtour as a Paſtour doth exerciſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miniſteriall acts not only in reference to his owne particular Church, to the ordinary Miniſtery whereof he is fixed, but alſo in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to other Churches Particular, Provinciall, Nationall, yea, and the Univerſall Church: For by Baptiſme he admits members into the Church Univerſall, <hi>1 Cor. 12. 13.</hi> By Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication he doth caſt members out, not of his own particular Church only, but out of the Provinciall, Nationall, and Univerſall Church, <hi>Matth 18. 18, 19.</hi> By his Paſtorall Office he offereth up Prayers to God for other Churches diſtreſſed: He may preach the Word of God in another particular Church, not only by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and reaſon of his gifts, but with Paſtorall Authority, ſo that by his preaching he doth bind and looſe ſinners, he doth retaine and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſins, and as an Embaſſadour ſent from God, doth beſeech men to be reconciled to God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is an Eccleſiaſticall Communion between divers particular Churches, not only in the common gifts of all Chriſtians, but alſo
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:119921:46"/> in the Paſtorall actions and adminiſtrations; for they are not performed beyond the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints: Particular Churches as they are Churches united into a ſacred fellowſhip, doe exhort, reprove, comfort, and admoniſh one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mutually; and conſequently doe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Communion in Eccleſiaſticall Authority, not only as they are Saints, but alſo as they are Churches. Miniſteriall acts therefore may be lawfully exerciſed by the Word of God, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers particular Churches, by the Paſtours of one Church.</p>
               <p>And therefore this practiſe is held forth in our Eccleſiaſticall Canons in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that the Paſtours of one Church exerciſe Miniſteriall acts in another particular Church, there with Paſtorall Authority they preach the Word of God, adminiſter the Sacraments, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit members, attend to Eccleſiaſticall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, chooſe Paſtours and Church Governours, &amp;c. and that to the great Edification of thoſe Churches.</p>
               <p>We reject therefore the oppoſite Aſſertion of thoſe, who affirme that a Paſtor may indeed in another particular Church exerciſe the gifts of Praying and Preaching the Word of God, but not by vertue or force of his Paſtorall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but only by reaſon of gifts which he is to imploy for the common edification: but that he may exerciſe no miniſteriall acts which he
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:119921:46"/> performeth by Eccleſiaſticall power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as a Miniſter of the Church, and of God, in diſpenſing the Myſteries of God, ſave only in that Church, to which he is faſtened by Election for his ordinary Miniſtery.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Question 3.</label>
               </p>
               <p>WHether the exerciſe of Propheſie be a perpetuall inſtitution in the Church of God, whereby private men who beare no Church-Office, may, for the exerciſe of the gifts of the Spirit, publikely before the whole body of the Church preach the Word of God with all authority in the Name of God, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and apply it, for inſtruction, confutation, reprehenſion, and conſolation of the hearers?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſwer.</label>
               </p>
               <p>OUr Judgement is that none may publikely, in the Church Aſſembly of the faithfull, preach the Word of God, in the Name of Chriſt and of God, but he who is ſent by a divine Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for that work; as the <hi>Protestants</hi> demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate againſt the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Anabaptists</hi> from <hi>Rom. 10. 14, 15. Heb. 5. 4, 5. Act. 13. 1, 2.</hi> &amp; 14. 22. <hi>Tit. 1. 5. 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 2, and other places and arguments; and from the examples of all thoſe, who either in an extraordinary or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner were ſent to preach the Word. Which Miſſion, or ſending, conſiſteth not only
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119921:47"/> in conferring gifts, whereby an <hi>Ability,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is given by God; but in conferring a power, whereby is given an <hi>Authority,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to preach the Word of God; which <hi>Authority</hi> is oft-times not conferred on thoſe, on whom yet God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes gifts and ability. For it is by the Word of God denyed to women, in whoſe lips is the Law of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 26. and a fitneſſe to teach the yonger women, <hi>Tit. 2. 3, 4.</hi> It is certain from the Word of God, that God injoynes all Beleevers to exhort, comfort, reprove, and edifie one another, <hi>Heb. 3. 13. 1 Theſ.</hi> 4, 18. &amp; 5. 14. but it is from the common duty of Charity, and the law of Nature, that they are thus bound: and therefore the word which they declare to their neighbours, doth not by the authority of any ſpeciall office bind to obedience thoſe that heare it, but by vertue of the ſubject or matter contained in that word. But the Churches Miniſters declare the Word of God as Chriſts Embaſſadours, with authority of ſpeciall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and power to bind and looſe, <hi>1 Cor. 4. 1, 2. 2 Cor. 5. 20. Joh. 20. 21, 22.</hi> There is therefore a many-fold difference between the Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive admonitions of private Chriſtians and the Authoritative preaching of Gods Miniſters. For 1. the Admonitions of ordinary Chriſtians are to our neighbour privately, and as joyned to us by the bond of Charity and the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: The Miniſters of Churches doe publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119921:47"/> preach the Word of God with paſtorall charge of ſoules, and Gods Authority, to the Church, as a Church, over which God hath made them Watchmen and Overſeers. 2. The Miniſters Authoritative preaching the Word hath joyned with it the Eccleſiaſticall power of binding and looſing ſinners, remitting and retaining ſinnes, <hi>Mat. 16. 18, 19. Joh. 20. 21, 22.</hi> which authority is not affixed to the Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive admonitions of private Chriſtians. 3. There is not ſo abſolute and ſtrict an obligation on private Chriſtians for that brotherly correction which is performed by them, as the obligation on the Paſtors of the Church of God for their office of preaching, who may not involve themſelves in the affaires of this world, to the end that they may wholly attend upon the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of preaching, <hi>2 Tim. 2. 4.</hi> and who are in a ſpeciall manner to give an account of the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their hearers committed to them, <hi>Heb. 13. 17. Ezek. 3. 18.</hi> &amp; 33. 18. which do not concern private Chriſtians in the exerciſe of charitative admonition.</p>
               <p>We grant therefore in this cauſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is a duty injoyned on all beleevers to ſpeake the Word of God in private to their neighbours, for their mutuall edification; and that they are obliged to it from the common duty of Charity, and the law of nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That private Chriſtians in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119921:48"/> caſe, in a Church to be erected, or that is decayed and ruined, may ſometimes publikely preach the Word of God, for the planting a Church, when there are not ſuch as by Gods ordinary call have received from God power to preach the Word. For the poſitive rituall law of God, gives place to the morall law of God, when neceſſitie requires it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We grant alſo that private Chriſtians in ſome ſpeciall caſes, and upon a particular occaſion, may ſometimes ſpeake the Word of God in publike, by a ſpeciall Calling from God: as Martyrs are called to a publike confeſſion of the faith.</p>
               <p>But all this doth not inferre, that there is an exerciſe of Propheſie conſtantly and ordinarily to be obſerved in the Church, whereby the Word ſhould by private Chriſtians in the Name of Chriſt, and with all authority be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely preached for the edification of the Church. And therefore we maintaine the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of the queſtion propoſed, and deny that there is ſuch an exerciſe to be perpetually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons on which we ground it, are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe preaching the Word of God, in the Name of Chriſt, with the authority of an Embaſſadour of God, is joyned with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacraments, <hi>Matth. 28.</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:119921:48"/> 19, 20. yea, and there lies a more excellent uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and eminency of the Paſtorall Office, in preaching the Word, then in adminiſtration of the Sacraments, <hi>1 Cor. 1. 17.</hi> But the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments is not to be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all indifferently who have thoſe gifts; as the Proteſtants doe ſolidly demonſtrate againſt the Papiſts: and therefore neither the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word.</p>
               <p n="2">2. No man may take this honour to himſelf, unleſſe he be called of God, and ſent to preach his Word in the Name of God, <hi>Rom. 10. 14, 15.</hi> But all who have the gifts of Preaching the Word, are not called and ſent of God. For thoſe who are ſent of God, are ſent either by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and extraordinary call, or by a mediate call by the Church: but whereas now an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Miſſion or Sending is ceaſed in the Church, thoſe are therefore by the ordinary Eccleſiaſticall call ſeparated to the Office of Preaching, who may lawfully undertake it. <hi>1 Tim. 4. 14.</hi> &amp; 5. 22. 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 2, 3.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe duties which are required of all thoſe who publikely preach the Word of God in the Name of Chriſt, are not required of all thoſe Chriſtians that are gifted: as that there lyeth on them the Paſtorall charge of ſoules, of which they are to give an account to God, <hi>Heb. 13. 17.</hi> that they ought to give themſelves wholly to the reading and ſtudying of the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:119921:49"/> Scriptures, <hi>2 Tim. 4. 15, 16.</hi> that they may not apply themſelves to the things of this world, <hi>2 Tim. 2, 4.</hi> that in the Name of Chriſt as his Embaſſadours they entreat men to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God, <hi>2 Cor. 5. 20.</hi> that they are to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to all and every one in the houſe of God their portion of food in due ſeaſon, <hi>Matth. 24. 46.</hi> that they are authoritatively in the Name of Chriſt to remit and retaine ſins, <hi>Joh. 20. 21.</hi> Now all theſe things are not injoyned on all Chriſtians who have received the gifts of the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hence alſo the Priviledges and Promiſes which are made to Paſtours, who preach the Word in the Name of God, are not given to all beleevers who are indued with the gifts of the Spirit; as, that they are worthy of double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. that God will by a peculiar and ſingular aſſiſtance of his Spirit be preſent with them, <hi>Matth. 28. 20. Luk. 21. 14, 15.</hi> And ſo a Prophets recompence and reward is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the reward of a righteous man, <hi>Matth. 10. 42.</hi> Therefore that labour, duty, and burden, to which theſe Promiſes are made, is not impoſed on all the righteous that are endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with gifts of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>We reject therefore the contrary aſſertion of thoſe, who affirme this to be an Ordinance perpetuall and ordinary in the Church, that a private Chriſtian indued with gifts, either or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:119921:49"/> or upon occaſion, being thought fit in the judgement of thoſe to whom it belongs, may (by the Word of God) preach publikely in the Church-Aſſembly with all authority, though he beare no Church Office. But to us it's certain, that even under the Old Teſtament in the Jewiſh Church, every one was not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſpeake publikely in the Synagogues, but that it was the ordinary function of thoſe that are called Scribes, and Lawyers, (the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites being alſo for this cauſe diſtributed into many places,) whereupon they are ſaid to ſit on <hi>Moſes</hi> chaire. If any were indued with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary gifts of Prophecy, as the Prophets in Iſrael, this was permitted and injoyned him by the Word of God, publikely to preach in Gods Name. When the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> was forbidden by the chiefe Prieſt to prophecy at Bethel, he doth not challenge this liberty to the Iſraelites, that they might publikely preach the Word of God in Gods Name in the holy Aſſemblies, but pleads his extraordinary Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby he was ſent of God to preach this word, <hi>Amos</hi> 7. 14, 15. And ſo perhaps was it permitted to the ſonnes of the Prophets, who were fitted, educated, and ſet apart for the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Miniſtery, <hi>1 Sam. 19. 20.</hi> In the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, after the reading of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets was ended, there were exhortations added; which Exhortations if at any time oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:119921:50"/> required, and it ſo ſeemed good to the rulers of the Synagogue, in corrupt times eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, it was indeed permitted to ſome, out of order, to teach and exhort; but they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſuch as had teſtimony of their gifts, and of whom there was a generall opinion of their Miſſion extraordinary or ordinary, by reaſon of the doctrine they preached, and the workes they did. Thus at <hi>Nazareth</hi> Chriſt was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Synagogue to read and explaine the writings of the Prophets, <hi>Luk. 4. 16.</hi> As one who by reaſon of his Majeſtie and Miracles did every where obtain audience, as reverend <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> here noteth; by which right he taught both in the Temple and every where: wherefore alſo the ordinary Doctors demanded of him, by what authority he did it, <hi>Matt. 21. 23.</hi> So we find that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were allowed, <hi>Act. 13. 15.</hi> publikely to ſpeake and exhort in the Synagogue at <hi>Antioch;</hi> as being ſuch whoſe fame was already knowne to thoſe of <hi>Antioch:</hi> for they had, before this time, for a whole yeare preached the Word of God to many there, and brought many to the faith of Chriſt; and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabus</hi> who was joyned with them, did by an extraordinary gift of Propheſie foretell to thoſe of Antioch the famine approaching; where were alſo many other Prophets and Doctors, who preached the Word of God both to Jews and Greekes: See <hi>Act. 11. 19, 20, 21, 25, 26,</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:119921:50"/> 27, 28. and 13. 1, 2. &amp;c. But in the practiſe of the New Teſtament, none but Prophets by gift and Office, either extraordinary or ordinary, were permitted publikely in the Aſſembly of beleevers to preach the Word of God in Chriſts Name, as appeareth <hi>1 Cor. 14. 29, 30, 31.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Apostle ſpeakes not of any in the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on promiſcuouſly, but of Prophets lawfully cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to instruct the Church of God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Beza</hi> on this place) <hi>and therefore they are not to be hearkned to, who from hence gather, that any of the Aſſembly may ſpeake in the Church, and who reprehend the cuſtome of having only a Sermon preached by one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So alſo in the practiſe of the Reformed Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick Church, according to their Synodicall Canons, none is admitted to the Miniſtery of the Word, but by a lawfull calling and due examination of his doctrine and converſation for the time paſt. <hi>No man</hi> (ſaith the Synod of Middleburgh, <hi>Anno 1591. art 6.) ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to the publike preaching of the Word, unleſſe he be an eſtabliſhed Miniſter of the Church, belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to ſome certaine Church.

               <p>THe opinion of the Reformed Churches is, that a certain Federall holineſſe, whereby thoſe who are in this manner holy have right to the meanes of Salvation, and the Sacrament of Baptiſme, and whereby they are diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from Heathens, Turks, and ſuch other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, <hi>1 Cor. 7. 14.</hi> is communicated to a whole Nation or people, to whom God ſo affordeth the tables of his Covenant as that they receive and profeſſe them, whom he cals and leades to the ſtate of his viſible Church, <hi>Rom. 11. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.</hi> This Federall holineſſe is transferred to poſterity, not by the next parents inherent holineſſe, by whoſe faith or unbeliefe their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate poſterity ſhould be deprived of it, or confirmed in it; but by the mercifull will of God, whereby he extendeth the outward pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of his Covenant, promiſed to parents even more remote, and doth conſtantly afford it to their poſterity profeſſing the faith for
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:119921:51"/> many generations, even to thoſe whoſe next parents were ungodly, and unfaithfull in the Covenant of God. Thus God often teſtifies that for the glory of his Name, and his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> he hath conſtantly kept and continued the grace of his Covenant, and the priviledges promiſed, for many ages, to thoſe children whoſe neareſt Anceſtors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling againſt God and unworthy of all the grace of the Covenant, had revolted from God: See <hi>Pſal. 106. 35, 36, 44, 45. Iſai. 63. 10, 11.</hi> and <hi>51. 1, 2, 3. Ezek. 20. 8.</hi> &amp;c. Again, Baptiſme was alſo inſtituted by God to be a ſigne of our ingrafting into the Communion not only of a Parochiall or Particular Church, but of the Church Univerſall and Catholike, <hi>1 Cor. 12. 13.</hi> And therefore thoſe who are within the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Catholike Church, though through neglect, or want of opportunity, or the like, they have not joyned themſelves to a particular Parochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Church, by a confeſſion of the faith, the knowledge, and worſhip of the Covenant, are to be admitted to Baptiſme, as alſo their children. But, that any be conſtituted in the viſible Catholike Church, it is requiſite that he imbrace the tables of Gods Covenant, that is, that he imbrace the Word of God, and the meanes of Salvation, and profeſſe the faith of the Chriſtian Church Catholike, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Worſhip of the Covenant, and live
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:119921:52"/> in that holy and viſible communion with the Church of Chriſt, which diſtinguiſheth them from thoſe that are ſtrangers to the Covenant, and inſidels.</p>
               <p>We hence affirm therfore, that in the Church of Chriſt Baptiſme lawfully may and ought to be adminiſtred, not only to thoſe infants whoſe next parents have joyned themſelves in a Church-Covenant to ſome particular Church, and in that Church-communion do lead their lives piouſly; but even to Infants of thoſe who have joined the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves to no Parochial Church, and by their wicked wayes have rendered themſelves unworthy of the grace of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, if ſo be they be borne of a Chriſtian ſtock, and baptized parents, who profeſſe the faith of the Chriſtian Church, the doctrine and worſhip of the Covenant; and by thoſe parents, or thoſe that are neere to them, under whoſe power they are, be according to the accuſtomed order of our Churches offered to Baptiſme.</p>
               <q>The Reaſons on which we ground it are theſe.</q>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe under the Old Teſtament, the Children of the Iſraelites were admitted to circumciſion, although their next parents had made defection from God, and wallowing in ſinnes to their lives end, had made the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Covenant as to themſelves voyd.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:119921:52"/> As appeareth, <hi>Joſh. 5. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</hi> where the Children of ſuch Iſraelites of whom many had dyed in their wickedneſſe, as well as of the godly, are commanded to be circumciſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> even of ungodly pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, who in the viſible Church profeſſe the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith, and the Doctrine and Worſhip of Gods Covenant, are under the Covenant of God, and indued with federall holineſſe: for their infidelity doth not make the faith of God and his conſtancy in diſpenſing the grace of the Covenant, without effect, <hi>Rom. 3. 3.</hi> Hence God cals the children of the ungodly Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, His children although they offered them to <hi>Moloch, Ezek 16. 20. &amp; 23. 37.</hi> For the ungodlineſſe of their next parents, doth not make void the efficacy of the Covenant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the following poſterity which live in the viſible Church; See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 18, 19, 23, 36, 37, 42, 43. And therefore thoſe priviledges and promiſes of federall holineſſe belong to them: and ſo the Church ought to conferre on them the Sacraments as ſeales of that holineſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe in the New Teſtament, thoſe of yeares were all Baptized, by <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> and the Apoſtles, Publicans, Souldiers, and whoever out of <hi>Judea</hi> and the Regions round about came to his Baptiſme, without any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger examination, if ſo be they profeſſed the faith and confeſſed their ſins; though there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:119921:53"/> them hypocrites, generations of vipers, and debauched men: And therfore the Infants of ſuch are likewiſe to be admitted to Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. This queſtion <hi>Walaeus</hi> diſputes at large, in defence of the practiſe of the Reformed Churches, in his common Places, <hi>Pag. 494, 495.</hi> of his Workes <hi>in folio.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>We reject therfore the contrary Aſſertions,</q>
               <p n="1">1. Of thoſe who deny Baptiſme to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of ſuch as live wickedly, and by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly life make the efficacy of their Baptiſme to themſelves of none effect. To theſe we op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the judgement of the Profeſſors of Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, in their <hi>Synopſis Theologiae,</hi> where they thus diſcourſe, <hi>diſput. 44. theſ. 50. Neither yet do we therfore exclude,</hi> ſay they, <hi>from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of this Sacrament, thoſe Infants who are borne of a Chriſtian ſtock, and baptiſed parents, though their parents by their ungodly life and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt faith have made the efficacy of the Covenant ſealed in Baptiſme, to themſelves of none effect; if by thoſe parents, or thoſe that are neare to them, under whoſe power they are, they be according to the order accuſtomed in our Churches preſented to Baptiſme, becauſe under the new Covenant the ſonne doth not beare the iniquity of the father; and God notwithstanding remaines the God of ſuch children: as himſelfe witneſſeth, Ezek. 16. &amp; 23, where he cals the children of the wicked Iſraelites his children; whom they had begotten
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:119921:53"/> for God, though they offered them to Moloch: and out of them alſo doth God ordinarily gather his Church by the ordinary preaching of the word. Wherfore alſo he commandeth the children of ſuch Iſraelites, many of whom had dyed in their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, as well as of the godly, to be circumciſed, Joſh. 5. 4, 6. and that this ought to be done both the Jewiſh, and the primitive Chriſtian Church have alwayes held without controverſy.</hi> Thus the profeſſors of <hi>Leyden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Of thoſe who deny Baptiſme to the Children of ſuch, as have not joyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to any particular Church by a Church-Covenant, though they acknowledge them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe godly. But, for that Baptiſme doth unite men not to a particular Church only, but alſo to the Univerſall Church viſible, we hold that it is to be denyed to none who belong to the univerſall Church.

               <p>VVEe judge that there is an Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and ſacred communion betweene particular Churches, not only as they are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a brotherly communion, and profeſſe one common faith and piety; but alſo as they are Churches and bodyes of a ſpirituall polity, and have and exerciſe a government and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall diſcipline in common. So <hi>Ames</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth, <hi>Medul. Theolog. lib. 1, cap. 39. theſ. 27. That particular Churches, as their communion requireth, the light of nature and the equity of Scripture rules and examples teach, may, and very often even ought to enter into mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conſociation, or confederation amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Claſſes and Synods, that they may ſo farre as conveniently can be, make uſe of common conſent and mutuall aſſiſtance, eſpecially in thoſe things that are of greater moment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet how much greater and further ſpace and remoteneſſe of diſtance there is between particular Churches, ſo much the leſſe alſo is the viſible communion of thoſe Churches: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the danger of ſcandall and infection, and the opportunity of mutual edification, is leſſe or more according as the diſtinct diſtance of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is greater or leſſe. Wherfore there is a more
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:119921:54"/> ſtrict viſible Eccleſiaſticall communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Churches of one Province or Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then between the particular congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church Univerſall; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the juriſdiction and Eccleſiaſticall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is alſo leſſe viſible between theſe, then between the Churches of one Nation.</p>
               <p>This communion of Churches in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Church diſcipline, is not only for the informing of Churches, what is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the word of God; but alſo for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning of them by laws and ſpirituall juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: for there is an authority and power of rule, belonging by the word of God to Churches joyned in Claſſes and Synods, which to particular Churches ſingly and ſeverally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not; to wit, a power of making Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and laws Eccleſiaſticall, which may bind all the particular Churches of one Province or Kingdome to obey them.</p>
               <q>We grant in this controverſy;</q>
               <p n="1">1. That the power of Claſſes and Synods doth not take away or hurt the power or liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Eccleſiaſticall of a particular Church: for it ſerveth to direct, preſerve, and promote the power of Synods is not privative but cumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and granted for this end, that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er given to particular Churches may be more efficacious, orderly, regular, able, and apt for edifying.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:119921:55"/>2. That there is a power belonging to a particular Church immediatly granted from God, not derived from Claſſes or Synods; as likewiſe there is belonging to Claſſes and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods a power of their own, immediatly gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, and not derived from the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches. For though in regard of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall, or the riſe and conſtitution of a Synod, particular Churches intire in themſelves, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterall one to another and equall in Church power, do in common, contribute, aſſociate, and exerciſe their Church power, and ſo make up a collective and combined body of a Synod: yet the Synodicall authority of it ſelfe is not granted to any other firſt ſubject, from whence it ſhould be derived to the Synod, then to the Synod it ſelfe, to which alone by the word of God and Apoſtolicall inſtitution that power belongeth: for no particular Churches ſingly and ſeverally conſidered, may exerciſe a Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall power over other Churches.</p>
               <p>But we affirme, 1. That this union and communion of particular Churches in a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and diſcipline Eccleſiaſticall in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which is exerciſed in Synods and Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is grounded upon the word of God, and in the examples of the Apoſtolicall Church is propoſed to us to imitate.</p>
               <p>2. That theſe Synods and Claſſes have a power and authority Synodall and Claſſicall,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:119921:55"/> whereby they do by ſpirituall juriſdiction au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively decerne matters Eccleſiaſticall, and impoſe thoſe decrees, under paine of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall cenſure, on particular Churches. Our opinion is proved by theſe following ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In <hi>Act. 15.</hi> we have in the Apoſtles practiſe an expreſſe example of a Synod, held at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> about a queſtion concerning the obſervation of the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> In which Synod, that buſineſſe which had wrought a diſturbance in the particular Churches, <hi>ver. 2, 4, 5, 23.</hi> is by the deputies of ſeverall Churches, <hi>ver. 2, 6, 23. Act. 21. 17, 18, 25.</hi> determined, with power authoritative to bind particular Churches to obedience, <hi>ver. 22, 28. chap. 16. 4. &amp; 21, 25.</hi> And the falſe doctrine of thoſe who ſubverted the ſoules of their hearers, is by an Eccleſiaſticall judgement condemned, with ſpirituall power, <hi>ver. 28, 29.</hi> which thing is an act of Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>Revel. 2. 2, 14, 20.</hi> and the determination of this Eccleſiaſticall law, was not by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Apoſtolike authority, but by an ordinary authority Eccleſiaſticall: for it was done not by the Apoſtles alone, extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acted by the Spirit of God, but by the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and brethren of the Church, joyned with the Apoſtles acting, not by their Apoſtololicall, but by their ordinary Paſtorall authority; with
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:119921:56"/> great diſcuſſion and diſputation, and the aſſent of the Churches; which argue that the decrees of this Synod were not made by an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Apoſtolicall authority, but by an ordinary Eccleſiaſticall power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our aſſertion is proved from Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, <hi>Mat. 18. 17, 18.</hi> where he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute ſuch Eccleſiaſticall Aſſemblies, as may by Eccleſiaſticall authority make proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and prepare efficacious remedies againſt all ſcandals and offences. If the members of a particular Church do give ſcandall to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he bids that it be ſhewed to a ſuperior Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Judge, to wit, the Church repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, which by Eccleſiaſticall authority doth condemne and puniſh, and remove from Eccleſiaſticall and brotherly communion the perſon offending; and therefore doth likewiſe command, that if particular Churches give of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to one another, it ſhould be carried to a ſuperior Eccleſiaſticall Judge, which may by ſpirituall authority condemne, puniſh, and put from Eccleſiaſticall communion the particular Church offending: for where the law makes no diſtinction or reſtriction, there muſt not we diſtinguiſh or reſtrain And certainly the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy inſtituted in this place, is ordained by Chriſt for the removing out of the viſible Church, all ſcandals not only cauſed by particular members, but alſo by whole Churches: and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:119921:56"/> therfore there muſt be acknowledged a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Eccleſiaſticall Aſſembly, which may by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative Eccleſiaſticall power judge of the ſcandall of particular Churches, as well as a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Eccleſiaſticall judge in a particular Church is to be acknowledged from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, for judging the ſcandalls of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar members. For ſince that according to the holy Scriptures we muſt grant that there is an Eccleſiaſticall communion between the viſible Churches of one Province, Nation, yea and of the whole World: as is proved before: which communion is not only fraternall, but Eccleſiaſticall, whereby Churches, as Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or bodies Eccleſiaſticall, are joyned and united in doctrine, government, worſhip, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Eccleſiaſticall polity: and ſeeing that in this holy communion ſcandals are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, which are unbeſeeming thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and to be caſt forth from that Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call communion: therfore both by the law of nature, and this divine law here inſtituted by Chriſt, we muſt acknowledge a ſuperiour Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Senat; furniſhed with ſpirituall and Eccleſiaſticall authority, which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move thoſe ſcandals. Hence <hi>Parker</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>de politia Eccleſiaſt. lib. 3. cap. 24.</hi> groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the authority of Synods on this place.

Where two or three are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in my name, there am I in the midſt of them, <hi>Matth. 18.</hi> and I am with you to the end of the World, <hi>Matth. 28. Which pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily are to be underſtood of the inferior Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: but there being an union and communion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves of all Churches, the ſuperior conſiſtories are comprehended likewiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We deduce our argument from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Iewiſh Church: For the Chriſtian Church borroweth her frame of her Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall polity from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitution, not pedago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall, but eſſentiall and perpetuall, of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church; and therfore the Churches Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtories are now lawfully conſtituted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſame forme, according to which the Eccleſiaſticall aſſemblies were conſtituted under the Old Teſtament. And the reaſon is, becauſe it is manifeſtly evident, that this order, (beſides that it was of old inſtituted by God, and by the fathers moſt religiouſly obſerved,) belonged onely to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or good order, of a Church, not to the pedagogy of the Law, nor the diſtinct nature of that government. But now, under the Old Teſtament there were Synagogicall conſiſtories in each City, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:119921:57"/> the Scribes and Levits being preſiding, ſome Elders of the people, and men more eminent in dignity were joyned to them: whoſe office conſiſted as well in teaching, as in moderating the actions of the Church, and who tooke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of beleevers manners, and diſpenſed pious reprehenſions, and Eccleſiaſticall cenſures to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the vices of offenders. And there was alſo at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a generall conſiſtory or <hi>Syne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drium</hi> held, to which the moſt weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were brought, which in the leſſer Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogicall judicatories, either by reaſon of their difficulty, or the diſſentions of parties could not be decided or ended. Se <hi>Deut. 17. 8, 9. 2 Chron. 19. 5, 6, 7. Jer. 26. 9, &amp;c.</hi> This argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our eminent and reverend <hi>Gerſom Bucer,</hi> in his diſſertation <hi>de gubernatione Eccleſiae, pag. 65.</hi> doth thus propoſe; and not to be tedious, <hi>it was requiſite to ſet downe distinctly, in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the order appointed amongſt the Jews doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the polity to be obſerved by the Chriſtian Church in holding their meetings. For firſt as of old the uſe of ſacred Conſiſtories, as well Synago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall in the ſeverall Cities, as the ſupreme at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, was appointed by Gods inſtitution, for the paſſing of judgements, and determining controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies. So in the New Teſtament even from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Churches birth, the Lord would have as well particularly in each City, as in many Cities in common, ſome form of ordinary judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:119921:58"/> to the end that both the Ordination of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters may be duly performed, and the cenſure of manners adminiſtred: elſe what could be more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, either then the Precept of Chriſt, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that he, who refuſed to heare his brethren, ſhould be brought to the Church; or the Apoſtles reproofe, reprehending the Corinthians that they had neglected to proceed in the publike judicatory of the Church againſt the incestuous perſon. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only had each particular Church their proper diſtinct Conſiſtories; but that alſo divers Churches when more weighty controverſies did ariſe, which could not in leſſer Aſſemblies be determined, did in the new Teſtament come together to one generall Councell, the hiſtory of the Apoſtles teſtifieth,</hi> Acts 15. &amp;c. <hi>And doubtleſſe not only this ordinary ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Court (or Sanedrim) was kept at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, but extraordinary Conventions called for the Churches Reformation, the eſtabliſhing Religion, and the ſincere Worſhip of God by a Nationall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and for other holy occaſions:</hi> See Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <hi>thereof,</hi> Deut. 29. 20. 2 Chro. 15. 9. &amp; 29. 4 &amp; 34. 29 Nehem. 10. 32. to 34. <hi>And ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions being celebrated for morall duties, the celebration of them lyeth as a duty on the Churches of Chriſt at all times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth Argument is taken from <hi>1 Cor. 14. 32.</hi> where the ſpirits of the Prophets are to be ſubject to the Prophets by Apoſtolicall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept: whatſoever therefore an Eccleſiaſticall
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:119921:58"/> Prophet doth in his ſacred function performe, either in ſacred Doctrine, or divine Worſhip, or Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline, it ought to be ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the judgements of other Prophets. Therefore one ſingle Prophet of this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church is to be ſubject to the judgement of Prophets of other Churches. And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Aſſemblies of many Prophets meeting out of divers Churches are here eſtabliſhed, to whom by the Word of God, the Spirits and wayes of Prophets of particular Churches are ſubject. Other arguments are alſo at hand in this cauſe, if we purpoſed to contend by number of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Hence alſo doe the Churches of the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands hold their Synods, endowed with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and power Eccleſiaſticall, which do ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their decrees on particular Churches, that they permit not a private or particular Church to alter the order eſtabliſhed by the Synods: but injoyne all to obſerve their Canons eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, till it ſhall be otherwiſe appointed by the Synods: See the Synod at Embden, <hi>Ann. 1571. art. 53.</hi> at Dort, <hi>Anno 1574. art. 91.</hi> at Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, <hi>Anno 1581. art. 69.</hi> at the Hagh, <hi>Anno 1586 art. 79.</hi> at Middleburgh, <hi>Anno 1591. art.</hi> 80. at Dort, <hi>Anno 1619. art. 86.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We reject therefore the oppoſite Aſſertions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of thoſe who allow to Synods and Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes no other power then of Counſell and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:119921:59"/> as one brother towards another, and one particular Church towards another Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Siſter Church, may be counſell and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion direct and exhort to their duty: ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have the whole number of Churches that hold Eccleſiaſticall Communion in Synods and Claſſes any other authority granted them by the Word of God, but to perſwade, exhort and admoniſh. Againſt whom we uſe no other arguments, then what Maſter <hi>John Cotton</hi> himſelfe hath, in a late Treatiſe in Engliſh, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>The Power of the Keyes,</hi> Chap. 6. <hi>We dare not ſay,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that their power reacheth no further then giving counſell: for ſuch as their ends be, for which according to God they do aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſuch is the power given them of God, as may attaine thoſe ends. As they meet to miniſter light and peace to ſuch Churches, as through want of light and peace lye in errour (or doubt at leaſt) and variance: ſo they have power by the grace of Christ not only to give light and counſell in matter of Truth and Practiſe; but alſo to command and injoyne the things to be beleeved and done. The expreſſe words of the Synodall letter imply no leſſe;</hi> It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and unto us, to lay upon you no other burden, <hi>Acts 15. 27. This burden therefore, to obſerve thoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary things they ſpeake of, they had power to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. It is an act of the binding power of the Keyes, to bind burdens. And this binding power ariſeth
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:119921:59"/> not only materially from the weight of the matters impoſed, (which are neceſſary</hi> neceſſitate praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti <hi>from the Word) but alſo formally from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Synod, which being an Ordinance of Chriſt, bindeth the more for the Synods ſake.</hi> Thus Maſter <hi>Cotton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We reject alſo their contrary opinion, who allow to Synods a power <hi>Dogmaticall,</hi> but deny a power <hi>Diatacticall</hi> and <hi>Criticall.</hi> A power <hi>Dogmaticall,</hi> which is a power and right of judging in matters of Faith and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion doth ſo belong to Synods, as that it is alſo given by God to ſingle Paſtors: For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle requires of Elders, not only to exhort by ſound doctrine, but alſo to convince gainſayers, and to ſtop the mouthes of the unruly, vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talkers and deceivers, <hi>Tit. 1. 9, 10, 11, 12.</hi> Doth not this plainly intimate that they are to judge of matters of faith, if in a Particular Church there ariſe a diſputation about any queſtion of faith, or the ſoundneſſe in judgement of one who is reckoned a member of that Church, be doubted of? This therefore is not the whole power of Synods, which belongeth even to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Paſtours. Hence there is alſo attributed to Synods a <hi>Diatacticall</hi> power, whereby they have right to manage the externall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, ſo that all things be done decently and in order, in the adminiſtration of Gods worſhip to the common edification of al.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:119921:60"/> Not only the Apoſtles, but the Elders alſo, did in the Councell at Jeruſalem decree, that the Gentiles who had given themſelves up to Chriſt, ſhould abſtaine from things offered to idols, and from bloud, and things ſtrangled, <hi>Acts 15. 25, 28.</hi> So when <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was received by the brethren, not only <hi>James</hi> but the Claſſis of Elders adviſed him, for the beleeving Jewes ſake, to joyne himſelfe with ſome, though too much addicted to the Law, who had a vow on them: and decreed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat him, that for the peace of the Church, and ſatisfaction of the weake, he would vouchſafe, ſo farre as in that caſe was yet lawfull, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelfe to the obſervance of the Law, <hi>Acts 21. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.</hi> We ſee therefore that a Claſſis of Elders do by a joynt care and endeavour provide for the obſerving of what with one conſent they judged expedient for the Church. I need not further inſtance in Councels, in which, that Presbyters joyned in conſultation and deciſion, for the eſtabliſhing Eccleſiaſticall decency and order, is ſo cleare by their Acts that none can be ignorant: So the Lawes of Eccleſiaſticall Government in the Netherlands are by the Synodicall decrees impoſed on particular Churches. And, that a <hi>Criticall</hi> power, which containes the right of maitaining and exerciſing the Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline, given by God to the Church, for the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:119921:60"/> judging and removing of ſcandals, belongeth to Synods and Claſſes of Presbyters, we ſhall by and by prove by places of Scripture: For a Synod may aſſemble not only to admoniſh an offending Presbytery or Conſiſtory of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church; but alſo, if they refuſe to heare, to cenſure them by ſuſpenſion, depoſition, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving from their Eccleſiaſticall function, &amp;c.</p>

               </p>
               <p>WE affirme in this controverſie. 1. That ſome heads in this argument are by the judgement of Scripture to be held undoubted; which our Reverend <hi>Bucerus</hi> referreth to theſe heads: <hi>First,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that Election and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Miniſters belong to the Church, not to thoſe that are without, who are ſtrangers from the commerce of beleevers, and have not yet applyed themſelves to their fellowſhip and conjunction. For no where doe we reade in Scripture, that ſuch had Votes in Election of Ministers. Secondly, that this holy action belongs to the whole Church, that is, to both its integrall parts, whereof the one is of thoſe who are Church Miniſters, the other of thoſe to whom they minister: which is evidently declared by teſtimonies which may be brought from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:119921:61"/> Thirdly, that this buſineſſe is not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſome one or few of the Preſbytery ſelected, but belongs to the whole Colledge of Preſbyters in common; which appears by the Example of the Church of Jeruſalem and of Antioch,</hi> Acts 1. 23. &amp; 6. 2, 3. &amp; 13. 1, 2. &amp; 15. 22. <hi>Fourthly, that the principall parts herein belong to the Miniſters of the Church: for they are to preſide and guide the Church, that the multitude through levity, or tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, or ill deſignes do not miſcarry; and therfore to teach and exhort every one, and moderate the whole action of Election with wholeſome and right counſels: Which is manifeſtly evinced by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies we have produced. I adde, laſtly, that the Nomination was principally in the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call perſons, the people were by their ſuffrage to declare their conſent to it. So when one was to be taken in into the place of Judas, the Apoſtles na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med two, and when one of them was choſen by lot, the Churches approbation was preſently added: otherwiſe they did by their ſuffrage concurre to the Election. But that the Apoſtles in the inſtitution of Deacons did ſomewhat more condeſcend to the multitude,</hi> Acts 6. 3. <hi>there was a peculiar reaſon for it: for that they were, (especially in that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of the Church, and when a murmuring aroſe of the Grecians againſt the Hebrewes) to put off from themſelves all ſiniſter ſuspicion of thoſe whoſe ſuffrages did not approve them. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi> Calvin; <hi>Luke</hi> relates that there were El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:119921:61"/> conſtituted in every Church by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> but he notes withall the way and manner of it, when he ſaith that it was done by ſuffrages, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſaith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: thoſe two therefore did create them, but the whole multitude, as the cuſtome of the Grecians was in Elections, declared by lifting up their hands, whom they would have. <hi>Calvin. Inſtit. lib. 4. cap. 3. ſect. 15. Therefore the chiefe of what the people were to doe, was of thoſe who were nominated to chooſe one. All which is fully cleare from Scripture.</hi> Thus <hi>Bucerus, diſſert, de gubernat. Eccleſiae, pag. 323, 324.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. But becauſe we are to account thoſe in Eccleſiaſticall Communion with us, not only who have joyned themſelves to ſome one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church as fixed members, but thoſe alſo on whom by reaſon of their function the charge and care of many Churches doth lie, and who are to take care that in them all things be done decently, in order, and to edification: hence the power of ordaining Paſtors is not ſo granted to a particular Church, as that abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by themſelves they may be the Word of God performe all thoſe things, that are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Ordination of their Paſtors; But if the Ordination of Paſtours in a particular Church be duly performed, it ought to be done in Church Communion, with the judgement, conſent, and poteſtative Miſſion of Claſſes or
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:119921:62"/> Synods, with whom that particular Church holdeth Eccleſiaſticall Communion. For Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Paſtours is not a thing peculiar to one Church and its members, but a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the Churches of one Claſſis or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod: and what concerneth all, ought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by all. That therefore a particular Church, in ſuch a matter of common concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do not do ought which may diſturbe the common order, or which in a like caſe may prejudice other Churches, they are in the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Paſtours to proceed with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent of all the Churches of that Synod.</p>
               <p>3. In the acts and exerciſe of power Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall in the Ordination of Paſtours, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, there is this difference between a Claſſis or Synod, and a Particular Church. 1. That as it is the act of Claſſes and Synods, it is <hi>actus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratus,</hi> as it is the act of the Particular Church is <hi>actus elicitus:</hi> that is, that Synods and Claſſes are to take care and authoritatively to enjoyne Particular Churches that they excite their power and exerciſe it, for the ordaining their Paſtours: But the particular Churches are to doe thoſe Eccleſiaſticall acts, whereby the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination it ſelf is performed. 2. That there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Synods and Claſſes an authoritative judgement of the ſufficiencie and ſutable ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the perſon to be ordained to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and of the due and orderly manner of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:119921:62"/> proceeding in the whole Election diſpatched, and the Ordination to be performed. 3. That it belongs to Synods and Claſſes to decree Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and preſcribe decrces, for the common edification of all thoſe Churches, according to which the particular Church ought to doe thoſe acts, whereby the Ordination of Paſtors is performed. 4. That the Synod and Claſſis doe authoritatively concurre with the particular Church, in the power of ſending Paſtours, and in the exerciſe thereof, by which an Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Right is derived on the Miniſter. For the Eccleſiaſticall Power, which is conferred on a Miniſter by Ordination, is derived miniſterial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſecondarily, and ſubordinately under God, not only from the Elderſhip of that Particular Church, but from that whole miniſtring or governing Eccleſiaſticall Society, into which the Paſtour ordained is admitted by Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to performe the exerciſes of the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Miniſtry. Thus we conceive theſe acts are to be diſtinguiſhed in the legitimate Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Paſtours, in a conſtituted and ſetled Church.</p>
               <p>4. In a caſe extraordinary, when a Nationall Church is corrupted and depraved, the due power of Claſſes and Synods overturned and deſtroyed, and when the polity of the Church ſo utterly ruined, as that there is no more any face of it to be ſeen, no where any to be found
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119921:63"/> that labour in ſound doctrine, no markes of a viſible Church diſcernable by the eyes of men: In ſuch a caſe the Ordination of Paſtours is in the power of the particular Church, who have received from God right to ordaine in this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity by their own Elderſhip: and therefore where there is no ſuch Elderſhip, they firſt goe about the conſtitution of it, and then being thus conſtituted they performe their Ordinations by it. For that is ſure, which <hi>Melancton</hi> doth oft inculcate; <hi>When the ordinary Biſhops</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>become enemies to the Church, or refuſe to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Ordination, the Churches retain their owne right. For where ever there is a Church, there is power of dispenſing the Gospell; ſo that of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the Church muſt retain a right of their owne to call, elect, and ordaine Miniſters. And this right is a gift granted to the Church, which no humane authority can take from it.</hi> Argum. &amp; Reſponſ. part. 7. de poteſt. Epiſe. argum. 2. That this power ſhould be wholly abrogated and brought to nothing for want of Paſtours, is not to be thought; but common ſenſe teacheth that it's better in ſuch a caſe to inlarge it, then that the Church ſhould be deſtitute of the large fruites of the Goſpels preaching: for that the Church ſhould be then deprived of this power, when the exerciſe of it is moſt chiefly required, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd. And on the other hand, when there is no particular Church, nor Elderſhip, in ſome
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:119921:63"/> place, where there is a Church to be planted and erected, and the diſpenſation of the Goſpel to be firſt introduced, here the neighbouring Eccleſiaſticall Aſſemblies, who are by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of occaſions invited by God to afford their mutuall help and aſſiſtance in this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all matter, have power of ſending Miniſters and Paſtours with Eccleſiaſticall power for the gathering, erecting, and promoting a Church in that place: for that manner of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is warranted by the holy Scriptures, <hi>Acts 13. 1, 2, 3.</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> are ſent by the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> to the neighbour Churches.</p>
               <p>Hence therefore, concerning the power of Claſſes and Synods in the Ordination of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and a particular Church, we maintaine theſe aſſertions.</p>
               <p>1. That a particular Church wanting a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, may not in the ordinary and ſetled ſtate of Churches, performe the Ordination of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors. But the Miſſion of Paſtors and Elders into a ſacted function is to be performed by the Governours of the Churches, which is proved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From expreſſe places of Scripture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Eccleſiaſticall act is injoyned the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours and Elders, <hi>1 Tim. 5. 22.

Our reverend <hi>Bucerus</hi> diſcourſeth excellently of this place, <hi>Diſſert. de gubern. Eccleſiae, pag. 339, 340. I know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the word</hi> Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, <hi>may be expounded either of the Colledge of Preſbyters, or of the Office of Preſbyters; but three reaſons chiefly perſwade me to think that we ought to reſt in the former ſignification. The firſt is, that we find it no where uſed by the Holy Ghoſt, ſo farre as I remember, for the Preſbyters Office. But that on the contrary, it's uſed to ſignifie their Meeting, is evident. For what</hi> Luke <hi>relates,</hi> Chap. 22. 66. <hi>that when Chriſt was apprehended, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Preſbytery of the people was gathered together, certainly cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the Preſbyteriall Office. So</hi> Paul <hi>at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, rendering an account of his faith, for teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of what he ſaid, citeth the high Prieſt, and the Preſbytery, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>,</hi> Acts 22. 5. <hi>Where eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one underſtands the word Preſbytery to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the Company of Elders not the Office. A ſecond Reaſon is, that there will appeare a kind of Tautologie in</hi> Paul's <hi>ſpeech, if by the word preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery we underſtand the Preſbyteriall Office; for the Gift, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which</hi> Paul <hi>bids</hi> Timothy <hi>not to neglect, in the expoſition of moſt, ſignifies that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it ſelfe joyned with a ſufficiency of Gifts. The Apoſtles words therefore would ſound to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:119921:64"/> Neglect not the Preſbyteriall Office which was given thee by Prophecy with the impoſition of hands of the Preſbyteriall Office. In good earneſt I like it not. I know that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is underſtood by ſome, only of the faculty of teaching; but when</hi> Paul <hi>addeth, that it was given</hi> Timothy <hi>by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, whether or no will you not judge this expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſuite better to the Office of teaching? for any one will eaſily diſcerne with me, that it is a harſh ſpeech, to ſay, that the Faculty of teaching was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on</hi> Timothy <hi>by Prophecy, that is, by a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Revelation of the Spirit, at the Prophets Command. But on the contrary, it's a very apt expreſſion to ſay, The Preſbyters Office was confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on</hi> Timothy <hi>by his Vocation both extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary declared by the teſtimony of Prophets, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, performed by the judgement of the Church, in obedience to the Revelation of the Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> Two things doth Reverend <hi>Bucerus</hi> here evince; that by Presbytery, is underſtood the Company of Presbyters, and that by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is ſignified the Office of the Miniſtery, together with ſufficiency of gifts. This place therefore doth aſſert, that the Miniſteriall Office by the Ordination of the Colledge of Presbyters, is committed to Paſtours by Gods Law and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall Inſtitution.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It appeares from the Apoſtles practiſe, wherein Ordinations of Paſtours were perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Paſtours and Miniſters that had the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:119921:65"/> Government of Churches, ſee <hi>Acts. 6. 2, 3. Act. 13. 1, 2, 3. &amp; 14. 23. Tit. 1. 5. &amp;c.</hi> Nor is there any example to be found wherein the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Paſtours was performed by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Church without Presbyters. And becauſe the practiſe of the Apoſtolicall Church is our ſafeſt rule of Church-Government; we judge that by Gods Ordinance it cannot be, that a Paſtor in ſetled ſtate of Churches ſhould be ordained, and put in poſſeſſion of his Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall function, by the multitude of the Church. See alſo what was ſaid, <hi>Chap. 4.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. We therefore affirme that Claſſes and Synods have power of ſending and ordaining Paſtours in particular Churches, which want Presbyteries. This aſſertion appeares alſo by the practiſe of the Apoſtolicall Church, which by Ordination did ſet apart and ſend forth Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours for the Miniſtry of neighbour Churches, <hi>Acts 8. 14. Acts 13. 1, 2, 3.</hi> And ſurely that in the Reformed Churches the right of Miſſion for the planting of Churches, or for the raiſing them up out of a defect, was alwayes practiſed by Claſſes and Synods, as is knowne to all who have but ſo much as heard any report of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches labouring under perſecution. As alſo the Apoſtolicall Synod, for ſupply of the Churches defect, choſe and ſent men for the performance of Eccleſiaſticall duties neceſſary to that end,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:119921:65"/> 
                  <hi>Acts 15. 22. It ſeemed good to the Apoſtles and Elders with the whole Church to chooſe men of their owne company, and ſend them to Antioch;</hi> and <hi>ver. 25. It ſeemed good to us being aſſembled with one accord to chooſe and ſend men unto you, &amp;c.</hi> Neither did the Apoſtolicall Churches do this by an extraordinary Apoſtolicall, but by an ordinary Eccleſiaſticall power; for they did this joyntly together with ordinary Elders and the whole Church, in an ordinary Synod. Theſe Examples therefore declare the ordinary right of Miſſion, to thoſe Churches who are deſtitute of a Presbytery or Miniſtery, or labour and grone under perſecution and defect. But, that Miſſion doth inferre Vocation and Ordination, and doth conferre power of preaching, and of ruling the people, Reverend <hi>Voetius</hi> proveth by many arguments, <hi>in Desperatâ cauſâ Papatus, lib. 2. ſect. 2. cap. 17.</hi> And it appeares from the word it ſelf <hi>to ſend,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, from whence comes <hi>ſent,</hi> and <hi>ſending,</hi> or <hi>Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which is nothing elſe but a <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> whereby a man hath ſome Function or Charge fully committed to him: which is nothing elſe but to call, and conſtitute: for as Miſſion or ſending is taken either actively, or paſſively, as it implies either a relation of him that ſendeth to him that is ſent, or of him that is ſent to him that ſendeth; ſo alſo Vocation, or Ordination. For all thoſe Metaphors, to ſend into the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:119921:66"/> to ſend into the Field, to the Lords work, to the Miniſtery and Charge of the Flock, &amp;c. ſignifie nothing elſe, but to call one to the Feeding of the Flock, dreſſing the Vineyard, or to conſtitute one a Paſtour and one that takes charge of ſoules. Hence thoſe that are called and conſtituted Paſtors of ſoules, are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Apoſtles, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>ſent:</hi> In Hebrew, the Prieſt and Paſtour of the Church is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is, <hi>ſent,</hi> a Meſſenger, or Embaſſador, <hi>Malach. 2. 7.</hi> of the originall and ſignification whereof <hi>Ludovicus de Dieu</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Append, ad Matth. 27, 2.</hi> where he ſhewes elegantly, from the footſteps of the <hi>Arabick</hi> and <hi>Aethiopick</hi> root, that this name is derived from <hi>ſending.</hi> Whence alſo Presbyters, whether the greater and extraordinary, or the leſſer and ordinary, lawfully ordained and called, are <hi>ſent</hi> to preach and to feed; and on the other ſide thoſe who are lawfully <hi>ſent,</hi> are ordained to preach. For to the actuall giving an Apoſtleſhip, or calling to the Miniſtery, that is, to an Active Miſſion of him that ſendeth, there is anſwerable a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Miſſion of him that is ſent, which is an actuall Receiving an Apoſtleſhip, or Miniſtery: for, or Relatives, the affirming one inferreth the other. The Ordination of Paſtors therefore for a Church that wants an Elderſhip, or is labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring under defects, which hinder the ordinary exerciſe of the Elderſhip, is lawfully perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:119921:66"/> by Synods and Claſſes under whoſe Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall communion they lived. So in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches, the Miſſion or Ordination of Paſtors which are ſent to Churches groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning under the Croſſe of perſecution, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the Claſſicall Aſſembly. See the Synod at the Hagh, <hi>Anno. 1586. art. 4.</hi> And ſo of thoſe who are ſent to the Churches of the Eaſt and Weſt-Indies.</p>
               <p>III. We allow alſo this power to Claſſes and Synods in the right of Ordination; That even in a ſetled and conſtituted ſtate of the Church, a particular Church which holds Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall communion with other Churches in a Claſſis or Synod; may not performe the vocation or Ordination of their Paſtors, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the authoritative judgement and poteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive miſſion of the Claſſis. This aſſertion is proved by theſe arguements.</p>
               <p>Becauſe he that is to be ordained is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the holy ſociety of the Claſſis or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, and into the Eccleſiaſticall body, as a member belonging to the Conſiſtory of the Claſſis or Synod; in the right of that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, and is therefore with their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſent to be admitted by Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into that ſociety. Becauſe alſo by Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a Paſtor is put into the poſſeſſion of his Eccleſiaſticall function; by vertue of which function he may performe miniſteriall acts of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:119921:67"/> his paſtorall office in other particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and exerciſe a miniſteriall authority in many caſes towards other Churches: and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon plainly ſheweth that it cannot duly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without the judgement of thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, over whom the perſon to be Ordained receives miniſteriall power. A particular Church may not lawfully Remove or Put-out a Paſtor from his Office, without the aſſent and authoritative judgement of the Claſſis or Synod, wherein he is duly admitted a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: therefore without that judgement they cannot lawfully admit into an Eccleſiaſticall office by Ordination: for it is of the ſame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to take in, and to put out: in what manner ought is contracted, in the ſame is it diſſolved. Hence in a Synod of the Churches was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Ordination of the Deacons elected, <hi>Act. 6. 3.</hi> with the common conſent of thoſe Churches. So 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. the Presbytery to whome the power of Ordaining is attributed, doth not only denote a Parochiall Presbytery, of which ſort both in townes, and in more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent villages, there were anciently one in each; but it ſignifies a colledge of Apoſtles or Apoſtolicall men; in whoſe number <hi>Paul</hi> was one, <hi>2 Tim. 1. 6.</hi> (as the Apoſtles are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called Elders, <hi>1 Pet. 5. 1, 2. 2 Joh. ver. 1, 3.</hi>) for this was done in the Church of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra,</hi> as the Dutch Tranſlators obſerve from <hi>Acts</hi>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:119921:67"/> 16. 1, 2. In which the Brethren of <hi>Derbe</hi> and <hi>Iconium</hi> were alſo actors, as is evident from the place; under whom are included alſo the Churches of the Region round about, as may be gathered from <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 6. And if thoſe moſt excellent ſervants of God, whom God had rendred eminent, by induing them with moſt ample gifts, and ſetting them in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of an extraordinary and more ſublime Miniſtery, would not yet at their own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure without the counſels of others, admit <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> (though named by the Spirits deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) into the order of Presbyters by publike Ordination, but thought fit for the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of order firſt to acquaint ſundry Paſtors and Churches with it; ſhall we who are no wayes to be compared with them, be yet in doubt what we ought to do? for not their ſayings on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but their doings alſo, ſhould be to us a rule what we ought to ſay, and doe. And ſo in our <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches, according to the order eſtabliſhed, Ordinations of Paſtors are perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the conſent and judgement of the Claſſis. As appeares by the Synod at the Hagh, <hi>Anno 1586. art. 4.</hi> at Middleburgh, <hi>Anno 1591. artic. 3, 4.</hi> at Dort, <hi>Anno 1619. art. 4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We reject therefore the contrary aſſertion of thoſe, who aſcribe to particular Churches in a ſetled ſtate of the Church, the abſolute
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:119921:68"/> power of ordaining their Paſtours, without the inſpection or authoritative juriſdiction of any Claſſis or Synod.</p>

               <p>In this controverſy we hold;</p>
               <p n="1">1. THat a Claſſis or Synod of Paſtors hath power to admoniſh and rebuke authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively, and with power Eccleſiaſticall, ſuch as offend, ſubvert ſoules by error, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſcandalls, <hi>Acts 15. 10, 24.</hi> This admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reproof, and condemnation in this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, was performed by the Apoſtles and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in order to Eccleſiaſticall cenſure. And this power not a power of Order, but of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction; performed not by the concionall key only, but the key of Eccleſiaſticall diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. For it's done not by one, but by many, by the whole Synod, <hi>ver. 6, 22.</hi> In the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an Eccleſiaſticall body, which had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by common adviſe to decree this rebuke, and what ever is determined in this cauſe, about that queſtion for which they came together: See <hi>ver. 2, 6, 23, 24, 25. chap. 16. 5.</hi> &amp; 21. 25. The cauſe in which it was done, was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a caſe of conſcience, but of ſcandall and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:119921:68"/> offence given in Eccleſiaſticall communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>ver.</hi> 19, 28, 29. with 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 24, 25, 26, 27. Rom. 14. 14, 15.</hi> Whereupon it is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, for the peace and edification of the Churches, that all troubles and unprofitable burdens ſhould be removed out of the Church, <hi>ver. 2, 19, 23, 24. &amp; chap. 16. 4, 5.</hi> and that in an Eccleſiaſticall aſſembly, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 15, 22, 25. So that this rebuke performed by the Apoſtles in order to ſpirituall cenſure was an act of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall diſcipline.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There belongs alſo to Synods and Claſſes this power, and exerciſe of Eccleſiaſticall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, to make Eccleſiaſticall laws: which are, determinations neceſſary for the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of morall precepts, eſpecially thoſe of the firſt table; and for the ordering the externall Government of the Church, that all things be done decently and in order to the common edification of all.</p>
               <p>By this power they eſtabliſh outward cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies ſutable to the due adminiſtration of the worſhip of God, outward formes of behaviour, and things indifferent, ſuch as tend to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward order, decency, and edification of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches, and make rules for directing the diſcipline of the Churches. The Apoſtles and Elders in the Synod decreed, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, who had imbraced Chriſt, ſhould abſtain from things offered to Idolls, and from bloud
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:119921:69"/> and things ſtrangled, <hi>Act. 15. 25, 28. Lamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Daneus</hi> diſcourſes ſoundly and accurately in his <hi>Poliria Chriſtiana, lib. 6. cap. 3. Moreover,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as for the rites and ceremonies, and the outward order which is neceſſary in ordering the Church, let an Eccleſiaſticall Synod be aſſembled with the command and preſence of the godly ſurpeme Magiſtrate, and this Eccleſiaſticall Synod duly gathered ſhall determine what that order, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall government of the Church ought to bee, &amp;c.</hi> See what was ſaid before of the Doctrinall power of Synods.</p>
               <p>This power of making lawes is a power of Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for it doth direct and diſpoſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatively thoſe meanes by which the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Churches is put in execution. For theſe lawes are made with the ſanction of a ſpirituall and Eccleſiaſticall penalty againſt delinquents, and conſequently proceed from that ſpirituall juriſdiction from whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth this threatning and inflicting of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall power. Againe the publike judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of direction paſſed with Miniſteriall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, of a ſcandall given or taken, of caſes of conſcience in the exerciſe of charity about things indifferent, of the ſpirituall edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, belongs to the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall tribunall, and Eccleſiaſticall juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But he that appointeth rites of order and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:119921:69"/> decency in the publike worſhip of God, and in the exerciſe of Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, muſt of neceſſity give a publike judgement paſſed by miniſteriall authority, concerning ſcandall given or taken, concerning caſes of conſcience in the exerciſe of charity about things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, concerning the ſpirituall edification of the Church: for to this end are Eccleſiaſticall lawes made, for the avoiding of ſcandall, for the ſpirituall edification of the Church, for the due exerciſing of brotherly love in Church communion. It is therfore an act of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all juriſdiction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Claſſes and Synods have an authoritative inſpection and judgement, not of diſcretion only, but of Iuriſdiction and approbation, in the exerciſe of excommunications from parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches; ſo that no particular Church which holdeth Eccleſiaſticall communion with other Churches in Claſſes and Synods may lawfully excommunicate &amp; deliver to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than any member of their communion without the authoritative judgement and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Claſſis or Synod. Which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by theſe arguments,</p>
               <p>That which concernes all, ought (in their own way and manner) to be handled by all, now the excommunication of any, in a conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate Church, concerneth all the Churches of that ſociety, for they all receive ſcandall, they
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:119921:70"/> are all liable to the danger of infection, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the communion which they hold in one Eccleſiaſticall body and ſociety.

The end of excommunication, that the evill and the leaven of infection be taken away from amongſt them, the Eccleſiaſticall ſociety pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from offences, concerneth not only the particular Church, but all the Churches of the Claſſicall or Synodicall ſociety; and therfore the excommunication is to be decerned by the judgement of all, that it may attaine the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end for which it is to be exerciſed in the Church; See <hi>1 Cor. 5. 6, 7.</hi> The cenſure of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and Condemnation, againſt thoſe brethren that troubled the Churches, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the ſoules of the godly, in the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was by the decree of the Synod performed and put in execution, <hi>Act. 15. 1, 6, 24.</hi> That degree or ſtep towards excommunication, ſhews that there is in the Synods power the judgement of the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication: for to that aſſembly to which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs an Eccleſiaſticall Reproofe and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

Claſſes and Synods have power to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Church Diſcipline and cenſure on the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Elders of a particular Church; or in thoſe acts of Excommunication which are appointed for keeping of Eccleſiaſticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons only to their duty. Which acts conſiſt in Prohibition, and Execution. <hi>Prohibition</hi> is,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:119921:71"/> whereby the Church forbiddeth to Paſtors and whole Presbyteries, under penalties to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on the diſobedient, what ever things are accounted ſcandalous to the ſacred Miniſtery, or do hinder publike edification; as, to involve themſelves in ſecular imployments, to take mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for admitting to Baptiſme, to retaine an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous wife, to take up armes in ſedition, to keep Hawkes and Hounds for hunting, to uſe gaming, to be preſent at dancings, and ſtage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playes, which have been forbidden in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels with judiciall and definitive authority, as may be gathered from the Acts of the Councels.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:119921:71"/> and Eccleſiaſticall Fellowſhip. Of theſe cenſures the Canons and Hiſtories of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church doe frequently make mention. And that in inflicting of theſe, Synods did improve their authority and endeavour, is konwn to all, that are not ſtrangers in the Acts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels. But let us conſult the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. When the Apoſtle commands the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Epheſine Claſſis, to watch againſt ſuch as ſhould ſpeake perverſe things to draw Diſciples after them, he intimates clearly that they had an authority to drive away wolves, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 30, 31. The Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was not a particular Church of one Congregation, but a Presbyteriall Church, or an united Society of many particular Churches; as we have proved before. The Synod at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> paſſed a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition and condemnation, in order to Church cenſure, on thoſe Paſtors who taught perverſe things, and troubled particular Churches with much diſputation, as hath been ſaid from <hi>Acts</hi> 15. And thus Cenſure, Suſpenſion, and Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Paſtors and Elders from their Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall function, in many caſes is attributed to the Claſſicall Aſſembly and Provinciall Synods, in our Eccleſiaſticall Canons in the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands. See the Synod at Dort, <hi>Anno 1578. art.</hi> 9, 99, 100. at the Hagh, <hi>Anno 1586. art.</hi> 39, 40, 72, at Middleburgh, <hi>Anno 1591. art.</hi> 58, 59, 60. at Dort, <hi>Anno 1619. art.</hi> 79.</p>

There belongs Authority to Claſſes and Synods, to paſſe an Eccleſiaſticall cenſure againſt the whole Conſiſtory of a particular Church, in caſe they diſturbe the Church with damnable errour, or pollute it with the leaven of vices: And if they obſtinately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to their perverſe doctrines and corrupt manners, then, according to the quality and greatneſſe of the ſinnes, by the dreadfull ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Excommunication to caſt them out of the ſpirituall Communion of the Churches, and deliver them to Satan. This aſſertion is proved: Becauſe a Synod of Paſtours by the Concionall Key, may authoritatively in the Name of God denounce an <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt a particular Church erring perverſly: For this one ſingle Paſtor of a Church may doe by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Office committed to him, how much more then a Synod of Paſtors? Now to an unity or Eccleſiaſticall College inſtituted by God, to whom by authority of their Office there belongs the Concionall or Doctrinall Key, there belongs alſo the Key of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Diſcipline, and the Exerciſe thereof: for in an Eccleſiaſticall Colledge or Society, God hath conjoyned the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven, and given them together, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17, 18. And in a Particular Church this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares evidently; to the Conſiſtory whereof, God hath given not only a Concionall and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:119921:72"/> Comminatory Power to denounce an <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> but alſo a Power of Excommunication joyned with it: And conſequently to greater and ſuperiour Church Aſſemblies alſo, hath God given both theſe powers joyntly. The Apoſtle attributes to the united Aſſociation of the particular Churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> a power of cutting off all thoſe Troublers, who corrupted the ſound Doctrine, and the peace of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 9, 10, 11, 12. what hinders there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but that they might exerciſe this power againſt a whole particular Church, or a Church Conſiſtory? Chriſt in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17, 18. eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the power of Excommunication in his Church by divine inſtitution, doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine the exerciſe thereof to be applyed only to a ſingle brother in a particular Church, though he give the inſtance in ſuch an one: for he doth inſtitute that Order in his Kingdome, whereby all ſcandals may be removed out of the Church, and cured by ſpirituall authority, whether committed by a particular Church, or by a particular perſon, or by whomſoever. And therefore if a particular Siſter Church in the Eccleſiaſticall Society of many Churches doe give a ſcandall to thoſe other Churches, they may by this inſtitution of Chriſt be brought into order by this ſpirituall Power. And ſurely it is cleare even out of <hi>Parker</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that the divine inſtitution of Claſſes may
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:119921:73"/> be proved from Chriſts inſtitution in <hi>Matt.</hi> 18. 17, 18. For, <hi>lib. 3. cap. 24. de Politiâ Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>câ,</hi> he thus argues from the proportion. <hi>Chriſt Commands that upon the deſpiſing one mans ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, we ſhould proceed to admonition by two or three; and, if that be contemned, to the cenſure of the Preſbytery; and, if that be despiſed, to the cenſure of the whole Church: and why not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from the despiſing of one whole Church, to more in a Claſſis? and againe, from thoſe more in a Claſſis, to yet more in a Synod?</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo by this Inſtitution of Chriſt, not a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church only, but a Claſſis and Synod al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo have power given of Excommunicating ſuch as commit ſcandals, if by this inſtitution of Chriſt the nature and authority of Claſſes and Synods may be concluded.</p>
               <p>And accordingly in thoſe hard times of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches, when the Church amongſt us was infeſted by the troubles and errours of the <hi>Remonstrants,</hi> whole Presbyteries of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were exauthorated by the Power of Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Synods.</p>
               <p>We reject therefore the contrary Aſſertions,</p>

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:119921:74"/> Inſtitution of Chriſt for this end, to ſave the ſpirit of man in the day of the Lord, and to teach from God, ſuch as be erroneous, not to blaſpheme: which to the legitimate cenſure of Excommunication doe appertaine, <hi>Matth. 18. 17, 18. 1 Cor. 5. 4. 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 20. In the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of a Siſter Church, the ſame degrees are to be obſerved by the Ordinance of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17, 18. which are obſerved in the correction of a brother; and therefore we are not to reſt in the admonition of two or three Churches: but by that order proceed to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, thereby to caſt out from the holy Communion of the Churches as a heathen and a publican, and to deliver to Satan, an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate offending Church.</p>

They are uſefull therfore for the underſtanding divine Scripture, as handmaids with due ſubjection; without any abſolutely neceſſary preſcription of uſing them, ſo that there be an agreement in one and the ſame true ſenſe: but are impediments and hinderances to thoſe only, who with Licentiouſneſſe rather then Liberty endeavour to overthrow, and feare not to call in queſtion thoſe principles which are as the foundations of our faith and Chriſtian diſcipline; and who aſſume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

For a Synod hath a peculiar aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt and ſo a greater then that which belongs to teachers judging ſingly and apart: They have alſo more certain meanes of finding out the truth; to wit, the Prayers, and Faſtings, &amp; Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, &amp;c. of the principall Paſtors of the whole Church: They have alſo a better courſe to know what is the opinion of the whole Church concerning a controverſie raiſed, and what courſe the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches obſerve therein.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:119921:78"/> Churches upon arguments but probable, and leſſe evident, gives an unbridled and endleſſe licence of contradicting any Eccleſiaſticall decrees whatever, Yea, when there is any thing of falſhood preſcribed in thoſe Formes of Churches, and that golden rule is to be followed, To obey God rather then men; yet a pious ſonne of the Church will not rudely inſult on them, but with a reverentiall baſhfulneſſe avoid them, as</hi> Waldenſis <hi>elſewhere ſpeakes. But when Formes are compoſed and establiſhed by Synod call authority, for the promoting and deciding of truth, the eſtabliſhing integritie and order in Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they have then Eccleſiaſticall and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive authority, whereby they may be impoſed on particular Churches in Doctrinall Cauſes, and Eccleſiaſticall affaires, under the penalty of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall cenſure: For the ſpirits of the Prophets, are ſubject to the Prophets,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 32 <hi>and all the Sonnes of the Church, are to be ſubject to the Diſcipline of the Church,</hi> Matth. 18. 17, 18. We hold therefore that to Churches congregated in Synods, there belongs power by the Word of God, that they may be Eccleſiaſticall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority preſcribe and impoſe Formes both of Confeſſion of Faith, and Eccleſiaſticall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which particular Churches, and their Governours, and private members are bound to confeſſe and receive under paine of Eccleſiaſticall cenſure. This Aſſertion is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:119921:78"/>1. Becauſe the Synod at Jeruſalem, by an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Power Eccleſiaſticall, did preſcribe and impoſe ſuch a Forme to other Churches in a queſtion in controverſie, <hi>Acts 15. 22, 29. and 16. 4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe thoſe things which the Churches of God ought to beleeve with the certainty of Divine Fiath, and undoubted Conſcience, theſe may Synods alſo injoyne, by Eccleſiaſticall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to particular Churches: For by the Word of God their power extends to require of others obedience to the Faith; and may in the Name of Chriſt with ſpirituall power bring under thoſe that are obſtinate, and who ſtubbornely oppoſe themſelves againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and conſtitutions of thoſe that are to governe the Church. They may therefore by Eccleſiaſticall authority impoſe on others Formes of Faith, and of obedience to the Faith, drawn up according to the Scriptures.</p>

Gal. 5. 12. 1 Cor. 4. 21.</hi> But Formes of ſervice, and confeſſions determined concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning queſtions in controverſie, are approved and juſt meanes for preſerving the purity of

               <p>Accordingly, in the ancient Synods of Churches ſuch Symbols, Eccleſiaſticall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Confeſſions and Declarations of Faith were ſet forth; that they might thereby teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie not only what themſelves did beleeve, but alſo what ought to be beleeved by others, with whom they would hold their Eccleſiaſticall Communion: as all the acts of Synods doe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, in which (where they ſpeake concerning Doctrines of Faith) they doe, by <hi>Paul's</hi> exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Anathematize thoſe who thinke or teach otherwiſe; whence alſo is that Preface of the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed, <gap reason="foreign">

For this you must be certainly reſolved of, that the Church of God cannot want Catechiſing; for that therein the true ſeed of ſound doctrine is contained, from whence a pure and good harveſt is afterward to ariſe, and ſo to be multiplyed more and more,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nor yet doth the benefit of a Catechiſme conſiſt only in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Children; for there is withall this other benefit, that both the people being thereby instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, will be better able to profit in the ordinary hearing of the Word; and alſo if any one being puffed up would bring in ſome new opinion, being called to examination by the Catechiſme, he will ſtraight be diſcovered.</hi> Thus <hi>Calvin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus alſo, in our Belgick Churches, is that authority applyed to our Formes of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, to wit, the Confeſſion, the Catechiſme, and Eccleſiaſticall Order decreed and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in Synods, that the Profeſſion, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and obſervation thereof is by Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall authority injoyned to all, who will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the dignity of the Eccleſiaſticall Miniſtery, and who live in the holy union of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, See the Syned at Embden, <hi>Anno 1571.

               <q>We reject therefore</q>
               <p>The opinion of thoſe, who grant it indeed lawfull for a private perſon, or even for a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, yea, and for all the Churches of a Kingdome to make Confeſſions and Formes of Doctrine and Diſcipline; but hold it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull and unprofitable to preſcribe them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Eccleſiaſticall or Civill authority as binding Rules of Faith and Practiſe, that men ſhould be conſtrained to obſerve them in Faith and the practiſe of Divine Worſhip. But now thoſe things that are to be retain'd with that firme faith, and unmoved conſtancy and certainty of mind, as that for the profeſſion thereof all beleevers ſhould not doubt to ſhed their bloud and ſuffer Martyrdome, and the Churches with the certainty of divine faith judge that ſo they ought to doe; thoſe things ſurely they may by Eccleſiaſticall and ſpirituall authority preſcribe to others, and conſtraine men to obſervance thereof in faith and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, under the penalty of Eccleſiaſticall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: But for the profeſſion of the pure faith, and of the ſpirituall Governement of Chriſt's Kingdome, all who are faithfull ſonnes of the Church are bound to ſhed their bloud: See <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 13.

               <p>IN this controverſie, we eaſily aſſent to what is written by <hi>Ames</hi> upon this queſtion in his
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:119921:81"/> 
                  <hi>Caſes of Conſcience, lib. 4. cap. 17. quaeſt. 4.</hi> and to what the profeſſors of <hi>Leyden</hi> have in their <hi>Synopſis Theologiae, diſput. 36. Theſ. 33, 34.</hi> And, that we may handle the queſtion diſtinctly:</p>
               <p n="1">1. We reject ſuch Formes of prayer, of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Sacraments, &amp;c. which for the matter of them are vitious: for we may not in prayers, and other parts of the publike worſhip of God, propound any thing unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, impertinent, and unfitting, which ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth of ſuperſtition, Idolatry, or hereſy, or carnall profaneneſſe, and pomp of the World, and which introduceth a communion with the unfruitfull workes of darkneſſe. And for this cauſe we reject the ceremonies and forms of publike worſhip introduced in the Church of England in theſe laſt corrupt times by the Hierarchicall Biſhops; as which, being ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious and idolatrous, did deface the Church and worſhip of God, and obſcure the brightneſſe and beauty of a glorious Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and a Church which takes up ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and idolatrous ceremonies partakes in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and idolatry.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We reject alſo thoſe Forms of prayers and publike worſhip, which by a tyrannicall and violent command are impoſed on the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men as abſolutely neceſſary and as eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall parts of Gods worſhip: though for the matter of them, they be legitimatly diſpoſed;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:119921:81"/> yet for the Form of them, and the manner of their introducing, they become illegitimate inſtruments of cruelty, and pretences for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe wickedneſſe, and occaſions of violent ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny againſt the worthieſt and beſt ſonnes of the Church. For there are not by Chriſt or the Apoſtles, (whoſe inſtitutions are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in the abſolutely neceſſary parts of Gods worſhip) any Forms preſcribed, as ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and abſolutely neceſſary, wherein they have drawne up an exact and immutable rule for all Chriſtians in Churches, in matter, and form, and method, to which all faithfull wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of God to the worlds end are to be preciſely bound.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The queſtion is not here, of the abſolute neceſſity of Forms, whereby they are obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as parts of Religion, and eſſentiall meanes of divine worſhip: but of ſuch a preſcribing them, whereby they are by Eccleſiaſticall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority commended for the order and decency of the worſhip of God, as uſefull and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for thoſe who want either ſufficient ability, or freedome of exerciſing it, for the ſeemly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of thoſe parts of divine worſhip, that they may be as it were guided by them as helps in their meditations, petitions, words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that the attention of the auditors, eſpecially in great Congregations, may by thoſe forms be helped and directed; and that there
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:119921:82"/> may be an Uniformity obſerved in the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of publike worſhip in all Churches, for the preventing of ſcandalls and for the greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defication of the Churches.</p>
               <p>But we judge thoſe Forms, as well publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as privatly uſed, to be lawfull and profitable, ſo that they be read out of the booke with due attention, reverence, faith, and ſpirituall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and zeale towards God: and that not only in caſe of neceſſity, when he that is to perform thoſe parts of divine worſhip is deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of ſufficient ability and fit words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the prayers and other parts of divine worſhip; but alſo for the helping and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the attention of the auditors thereby, and for keeping an uniformity in the exerciſes of Divine Worſhip, for the edification of the Churches of God. This Aſſertion is proved:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe we may in a preſcript form ſing Pſalmes, and offer thankſgivings to God with due reverence, faith, ſpirituall affection and zeale. <hi>Aſaph</hi> and his brethren had Forms for the due praiſing of God preſcribed them by <hi>David,</hi> according to the preſcript whereof they were in ſet words to celebrate publike thankſgivings; See <hi>1 Chron. 16. 7, 8.</hi> So in the dedication of the Temple, the Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites did celebrate the publike worſhip of God according to the ſet-Forms preſcribed by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, 2 Chron. 7. 6.</hi> The like examples we have,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:119921:82"/> 
                  <hi>Numb. 6. 22, 23. 2 Chron, 20. 21. Eſra. 3. 10, 11. Pſal. 92. 1.</hi> But now if thankſgivings, and ſinging of Pſalmes, which ought to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with ſpirituall affection, reverence, and underſtanding, and joy, <hi>1 Cor. 14, 15. Epheſ. 5. 19. Col. 3. 16.</hi> both lawfully may be and were performed according to the Word of God, in ſet Forms; then alſo Prayers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of Divine Worſhip may in ſet Forms be duly and lawfully conceived and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to God: for thanksgivings and bleſſing of God are kinds of prayer, and of the ſame nature, which require the ſame affections of mind with other parts of Divine Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That is a juſt and lawfull forme of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in which are obſerved the eſſentialls and neceſſary requiſites to all prayers. But all things which in the holy Scripture are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the due conſtitution of prayers, may be obſerved, and by the godly are obſerved in a holy manner in prayers conceived in ſet Forms, and pronounced out of a booke: Therfore this form of prayers is juſt and lawfull. For what is there in Scripture required to the worſhip of ſupplications, and godly prayers, but that the matters of them be lawfull, and ſtily diſpoſed according to the preſent neceſſities, that they be offered to God in a holy manner, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, zeale, humility, and faith; and that they duly expreſſe our urging neceſſities? But
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:119921:83"/> we know by certaine experience that a prayer holy and lawfull for the matter of it, may in a ſet Form be pronounced, and offered to God, with an humble ſence of our neceſſities, deſire, and zeal, holineſſe of affections, faith, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious motions of our will towards God, and that according as our affairs require. The faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reade the text of holy Scripture with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, humility, reverence, zeale, religious motions of the will, and faith in God, and application of them to particular neceſſities: and why may not prayers in like manner be pronounced in preſcript formes? when as pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers differ in this only from hearing and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Word of God, that in the one, our will is moved towards God that we may be moved by him; but in the other, our will is moved towards God that he may be affected with our deſires: as <hi>Ames</hi> elſewhere obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our Lord and Saviour Chriſt hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed us a form of prayer; For he hath given us the Lords-Prayer, not only as a pattern or platform according to which we ought to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our prayers, but alſo as a prayer which when we pray we may ſay; <hi>Pray ye therfore thus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Our Father, &amp;c. Mat. 6. 9.</hi> and <hi>when ye pray ſay, Our Father, &amp;c. Luk. 11. 2.</hi> Our Lord therfore did not only deliver a rule for prayer, but compoſed this prayer in ſet words,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:119921:83"/> and commended it to us not only for imitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but to be uſed in prayer: affording us in mercy a moſt uſefull help for our infirmities, and not to be deſpiſed, and a perfect ſupply of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of our prayers; the uſe whereof though not alwayes neceſſary, yet we judge it oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſafe and convenient, our Lord himſelfe ſuggeſting theſe words and commending the uſe of them. Hence in all the Liturgies of Reformed Churches that are extent, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſing the Lords-Prayer is preſcribed. So Chriſt hath preſcribed us an expreſſe Form of Baptizing, <hi>Matth. 28. Mark 16.</hi> and though the Churches of Chriſt are not by abſolute neceſſity tied to the ſyllables of it, yet in the ſence and ſubſtance of it we muſt admit no mutation. As alſo the ancient Jewiſh Church had their ſet forms in the uſe of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, bleſſings and thankſgivings in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Paſſeover: which alſo Chriſt by his practiſe did approve to be retained; See Mr <hi>Beza,</hi> on <hi>Matth. 26. 20. Paulus Brugenſis</hi> on <hi>Pſalm. 112.</hi> and <hi>Scaliger de E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendat. Temporum, lib. 6.</hi> whom he there citeth: as alſo <hi>Ainſworth</hi> himſelfe on <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 8. So likewiſe our Saviour hath by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample preſcribed a Forme of words for the Lords Supper, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike Church thought good to retain, and is by the Apoſtles propoſed to us to imitate; as
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:119921:84"/> appeareth from <hi>1 Cor. 11.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence alſo in almoſt all Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Eccleſiaſticall Lyturgies, and Formes of Prayers are approved, as uſefull and conducing to the edification of the Church: And, in our <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches, Formes of Divine Worſhip are together with our Pſalters, and the greater and leſſer Catechiſme, allowed, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely extant to the view of the whole world, and carried to the utmoſt Indies. Maſculine is the opinion of the eminent and Reverend Maſter <hi>John Calvin, Epiſt. 87.</hi> to the Protectour of England. <hi>As for the Formes of Prayers, and Eccleſiaſticall rites,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I much approve it, that there be one certain Form extant, from which Miniſters in their function may not depart; as well that thereby proviſion may be made for the ſimplicity and unskilfulneſſe of ſome; as alſo that the conſent of all the Churches amongſt themſelves may ſo more certainly appeare: laſtly alſo, that the petulant lightneſſe of ſome may be prevented, who affect innovations; to which end alſo, the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme tendeth, as I have before ſhewed. So there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there ought to be a ſet Forme of Catechiſme, of adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and of publike Prayers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe arguments doe alſo manifeſtly ſhew, that Eccleſiaſticall Communion in Divine Worſhip may be held with thoſe Churches, which retain ſet Formes of Prayers and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:119921:84"/> in the publike Worſhip. For no where hath God commanded that a Chriſtian ſhould ſeparate himſelfe from that worſhip which is performed by a preſcript Forme: and Chriſt himſelfe hath preſcribed to his Churches Formes of Prayer and Sacraments; and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated the Exerciſes of Divine Worſhip, according to the appointed Formes of the Jewiſh Churches, and we thinke it unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to condemne all thoſe Godly Churches, as guilty of ſuperſtition and will-worſhip, which from the times of the Apoſtles and the Primitive Churches downward, even to this day, have celebrated the publike Worſhip of God, in preſcript and ſet Formes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we blame the preciſe ſingularity of thoſe men, who baniſh all ſet Formes from the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and ſeparate themſelves from all the Proteſtant Churches into private and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Congregations of their own, becauſe of the Formes uſed by the Proteſtants in the Worſhip of God.</p>
